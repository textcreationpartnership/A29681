            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">Prov. 21.11</note> 
               <hi>That a word fitly ſpoken is like Apples of gold in pictures of ſilver,</hi> or as the Hebrew hath
<pb facs="tcp:62683:3"/>it, a word ſpoken (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wheels, that is, rightly ordered, placed, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated. Such a word is of all words the moſt excellent, the moſt prevalent, and the moſt pleaſant word that can be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: ſuch a word is indeed a word that is like <hi>Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver;</hi> of all words ſuch a word is moſt precious, moſt ſweet, moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, and moſt delectable. O Sirs, to time a word, to ſet a word upon the wheels, to ſpeak a word to purpoſe is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Book. Though all truths are glorious, yet there is a double glory upon ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truths; and therefore I have made it my great buſineſs in this Treatiſe to hold forth as ſeaſonable a truth, and as weighty a truth, and as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb facs="tcp:62683:3"/>and incouraging a truth as any I know in all the Book of God. The Mother of King <hi>Cyrus</hi> willed, that the words of thoſe that ſpoke unto her ſon, ſhould be in ſilk, but certainly ſeaſonable words are alwayes better than ſilken words.</p>
            <p>Every prudent husbandman obſerves his fitteſt ſeaſons to ſow his ſeeds, and therefore ſome he ſowes in the <hi>Autumn</hi> and fall of the Leaf, and ſome in the <hi>Spring</hi> and renewing of the year; ſome he ſowes in a dry ſeaſon, and ſome he ſowes in a wet; ſome he ſowes in a moiſt clay, and ſome he ſowes in a ſandy dry ground, as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſpeaks,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.25.</note> 
               <hi>He ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Fitches and the Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and caſteth in Wheat by meaſure.</hi> And ſo all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb facs="tcp:62683:4"/>husbandmen muſt wiſely obſerve their fitteſt ſeaſons for the ſowing of that immortal ſeed that God hath put into their hands, and ſuch a thing as this is I have had in my eye; but whether I have hit the mark, or miſt it, let the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader judge.</p>
            <p>One ſpeaking of the glory of heaven, ſaith, That the good things of eternal life are ſo many, that they exceed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo great that they exceed meaſure, and ſo precious that they are above all eſtimation, &amp;c. the ſame may I ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Saints portion, for certainly the good things that are in their portion, in their God, are ſo many that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed number, ſo great that they exceed meaſure, and ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that they are above all eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:62683:4"/>
            <p>The ſame Author in one of his Epistles hath this remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relation, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſame day wherein <hi>Jerom</hi> died, he was in his Study, and had got pen, ink, and paper to write ſomething of the glory of heaven to <hi>Jerom,</hi> and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly he ſaw a light breaking into his Study, and ſmelt alſo a very ſweet ſmell, and this voice he thought he heard. O <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> what doeſt thou? doſt think to put the Sea into a little veſſel? when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall ceaſe from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion, then ſhalt thou be able to underſtand what the glory of heaven is, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, except you come to feel it, as I now do. Certainly, the glory of heaven is beyond all conception, and all expreſſion, and ſo is that portion that is
<pb facs="tcp:62683:5"/>a little hinted at in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe. And indeed a full deſcription of that God that is the believers portion, is a work too high for an <hi>Aaron</hi> when ſtanding upon Mount <hi>Hor;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 20. &amp; ch. 33. Deut. 32.49. and chap. 34.1. Iſa. 6.3.</note> or for a <hi>Moſes,</hi> when ſtanding on the top of <hi>Nebo</hi> after a <hi>Piſgah</hi> proſpect; yea, it is a work too high and too hard for all thoſe bleſſed Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims that are ſtill a crying before the throne of God, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, holy, holy is the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> No finite being, though never ſo glorious, can ever be able fully to comprehend an infinite being. In the ſecond Verſe of the ſixth of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> we read that each Seraphim had ſix wings, and that with twain he covered the face of God, with twain his feet, and with twain he did ſly, intimating
<pb facs="tcp:62683:5"/>(as one well obſerves upon the place) that with twain they covered his face,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide Origen</hi> on the Text.</note> the face of God, not their own face, and with twain they covered his feet, not their own feet; They covered his face, his beginnig being unknown; they covered his feet, his end being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, onely the middle are to be ſeen the things which are, whereby there may be ſome glimmering knowledge made out what God is.
<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.24. There are many depths in God which our ſhallow reaſon cannot fathom; &amp; indeed it is the credit of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the glory of our God, that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable</note> The wiſe man hit it, when he ſaid, <hi>That which is afar off, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deep, who can find it out?</hi> who can find out what God is? The knowledge of him <hi>a priori</hi> is ſo far off, that he whoſe arm is able to break even a bow of ſteel is not able to reach it; ſo far off, that he who is able to make his neſt with the Eagle is
<pb facs="tcp:62683:6"/>not able to ſly unto it. And ſo exceeding deep that he who could follow the <hi>Leviathan</hi> could not fathom it; that he who could ſet out the center of the earth, is not able to find it out; And who then is able to reach it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In a word, ſo far off, and ſo deep too, that the Depth ſaith, it is not in me, and the Sea ſaith, it is not in me; it is ſuch a deep to men and Angels as far exceeds the capacity of both. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking to that queſtion,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. de fide contra Arrionum, cap. 6.</note> what God is? gives this anſwer; Surely ſuch a one is he, who when he is ſpoken of, cannot be ſpoken of; who when he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, cannot be conſidered of, who when he is compared to any thing cannot be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and when he is defined groweth greater by defining of
<pb facs="tcp:62683:6"/>him.
<note place="margin">Such are not onely good Scholars, but alſo great Scholars, who have learned content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to be ignorant where God would not have them knowing.</note> If that great Apoſtle that learned his Divinity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Angles, yea, to whom the Holy Ghost was an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Tutor, did know but in part, then certainly thoſe that are moſt acute and judicious in divine knowledge, may very well conclude, that they know but part of that part that was known to him. As for my own part, I dare pretend but to a ſpark of that knowledge that others have attained to; and yet who can tell but that God may turn this ſpark into ſuch a flame as may warm the hearts of many of his dear and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ones. Much is done many times by a ſpark.</p>
            <p>O Sirs, catch not at the preſent profits, pleaſures, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and honours of this world, but lay up a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb facs="tcp:62683:7"/>for the time to come, provide for eternity, make ſure your intereſt and propriety in God. It was an excellent ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavyer,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Germany,</hi> Such goods (ſaid he) are worth getting and owning, as will not ſink or waſh away, if a Shipwrack happen. How many of you have loſt your all by Shipwracks? and how hath divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by your multiplied croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and loſſes taught you that the good things and the great things of this world cannot be made ſure. How many of you have had rich inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces left you by your fathers, beſides the great portions that you have had with your wives, and the vaſt eſtates that you have gained by Trading; but what is become of all? is not
<pb facs="tcp:62683:7"/>all buried in the deep, or in the grave of oblivion? O the unconſtancy, and the grand impoſtury of this world! Oh the flux and reflux of riches, greatneſſe, honours, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments! how many men have we ſeen ſhining in their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pomp and glory like ſtars in the Firmament, who are now vaniſhed into ſmoak or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets? How hath the Moon of many great mens riches and honours been eclipſed at the full, and the Sun of their pomp gone down at noon?</p>
            <p>It was (ſaith the Hiſtorian) a wonderful precedent of the vanity and variety of humane condition to ſee mighty <hi>Exerx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> to float and ſly away in a ſmall Veſſel,
<note place="margin">Juſtin.</note> who but a little before wanted Sea-room for his Navy. The <hi>Dutch</hi> to expreſs
<pb facs="tcp:62683:8"/>the worlds vanity and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty have very wittily pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a man with a full blown bladder on his ſhoulders, and another ſtanding by pricking the bladder with a pin, with this Motto, <hi>Quamſubito,</hi> how ſoon is all blown down? I am not willing to make the Porch too wide, elſe I might have given you famous inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the vanity and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all worldly wealth, pomp, and glory, from the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Chaldean, Perſian, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdomes, whoſe glory now lies all in the duſt. By all this it is moſt evident that earthly portions cannot be made ſure, <hi>they make themſelves wings, and they fly away, Prov. 23.5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O but now God is a portion that may be made ſure. In the
<pb facs="tcp:62683:8"/>time of the <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Fox, Acts and Monum.</hi>
               </note> there was a woman who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convened before bloody <hi>Bonner,</hi> (then Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don)</hi> upon the trial of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he threatned her that he would take away her husband from her: Saith ſhe, Christ is my husband; I will take away thy child, Chriſt, ſaith ſhe, is better to me than ten ſons; I will ſtrip thee, ſaith he, of all thy outward comforts, but Chriſt is mine, ſaith ſhe, and you cannot ſtrip me of him. A Chriſtian may be ſtript of any thing but his God, he may be ſtript of his eſtate, his friends, his relations, his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, his life, but he can never be ſtript of his God. As God is a portion that none can give to a Chriſtian, but himſelf; ſo God is a portion that none can

            <p>O Sirs, that you would judge that only worth much now, which will be found of much worth at laſt, when you ſhall lie upon a dying bed, and ſtand before a Judgment-ſeat. O that men would prize and value all earthly portions now, as they will value them when they come to die, and when their ſouls ſhall ſit upon their trembling lips, and when there ſhall be but a ſhort ſtep between them and eternity, O at what a poor rate, at what a low rate do men value their earthly porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then certainly it will be
<pb facs="tcp:62683:9"/>their very great wiſdome to value their earthly portions now as they would value them then. And O that men would value this glorious, this match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe portion that is held forth in this Treatiſe now, as they will value it and prize it when they come to die, and when they come to lanch out into the ocean of eternity. I have read of a <hi>Stationer,</hi> who being at a <hi>Fair,</hi> hung out ſeveral pictures of men famous in their kinds, among which he had alſo the Picture of Chriſt, upon which divers men bought according to their ſeveral fancies; the souldier buyes his <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Lawyer his <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian his <hi>Galen,</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher his <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the Poet his <hi>Virgil,</hi> the Orator his <hi>Cicero,</hi> and the Divine his <hi>Auguſtine;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62683:10"/>but all this while the picture of Chriſt hung by as a thing of no value, till a poor Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had no more money then would purchaſe that, bought it, ſaying, <hi>Now every man hath taken away his God, let me have mine too.</hi> O Sirs, it would make any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, any ſerious, any ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, any conſcientious beart to bleed to ſee at what a high rate all ſorts and ranks of men do value earthly portions, which at beſt are but counterfeit pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, when as this glorious portion that is here treated on hangs by as a thing of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, of no price; moſt men are mad upon the world, and ſo they may have much of that for their portion, they care not whether ever they have God for their portion, or no:
<pb facs="tcp:62683:10"/>Give them but a Palace in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Burbone.</hi>
               </note> and then with that French Duke they care not for a place in Paradiſe: Give them but a meſſe of pottage, and let who will take the birthright; give them but Manna in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and let who will take the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> give them but ground which is pleaſant and rich, and then with the <hi>Reubenites</hi> they will gladly take up their reſt on this ſide the Holy Land; give them but their bags full,
<note place="margin">Luke 12.16-22.</note> and their barns full, and then with the rich fool in the Goſpel, they can think of nothing but of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their eaſe, and of eating, and drinking, and making merry. So bruitiſh and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh are they in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, as if their precious and immortal ſouls were good
<pb facs="tcp:62683:11"/>for nothing, but as ſalt to keep their bodies from rotting and ſtinking.</p>
            <p>O that theſe men would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider, that as a cup of pleaſant wine offered to a condemned man in the way to his execution; and as the Feaſt of him who ſate under a naked ſword hanging perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over his head by a ſlender thread, and as <hi>Adams</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, ſeconded by a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſword, and as <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> dainties overlooked by an hand-writing againſt the wall, ſuch and onely ſuch are all earthly portions to thoſe that have not God for their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Well, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> remember this, there is no true happineſſe to be found in any earthly por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb facs="tcp:62683:11"/>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> having made a critical enquirie after the excellency of all creature-comforts, gives this in as the ultimate extraction from them all, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi> If you ſhould go to all the creatures round, they will tell you that happineſſe is not in them: If you ſhould go to the earth, the earth will tell you that happineſſe grows not in the furrows of the field. If you go to the Sea, the Sea will tell you, that happineſſe is not in the Treaſures of the deep; If you go to the beaſts of the field, or to the birds of the air, they will tell you, that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not to be found on their backs, nor in their bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; If you go to your bags or heaps of gold and ſilver, they will tell you that happineſſe is
<pb facs="tcp:62683:12"/>not to be found in them; If you go to Crowns and Scepters, they will tell you that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is too precious and too glorious a Gemme to be found in them.</p>
            <p>As it is not the great Cage that makes thn bird ſing, ſo it is not the great eſtate that makes the happy life, nor the great portion that makes the happy ſoul. There is no true comfort, nor no true happineſſe to be drawn out of the ſtanding pools of outward ſufficiencies; all true comfort and happineſs is onely to be found in having of an all-ſufficient God for your portion, <hi>Pſal. 144.15. Happy is that people that is in ſuch a caſe, yea, happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> And therefore as ever you would be happy in both
<pb facs="tcp:62683:12"/>worlds, it very highly concerns you to get an intereſt in God, and to be reſtleſſe in your own ſouls till you come to enjoy God for your portion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> man that hath God for his portion, is a none-ſuch,
<note place="margin">This you will finde fully clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> he is the rareſt and the happieſt man in the world, he is like the morning-ſtar in the midst of the clouds, he is like the Moon when it is at full, he is like the flower of the Roſes in the Spring of the year, he is like the Lillies by the Springs of waters, he is like the branches of Frankincenſe in the time of Summer, he is like a veſſel of maſſie gold that is ſet about with all manner of precious ſtones.</p>
            <p>Nothing can make that man miſerable that hath God for
<pb facs="tcp:62683:13"/>his portion, nor nothing can make that man happy that wants God for his portion: the more rich, the more wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; the more great, the more graceleſſe; the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, the more miſerable that man will be that hath not God for his portion. The <hi>Sodomites</hi> were very wealthy; and who more wanton and wicked than they? the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> were very rich, great, and potent in the world, and what greater oppreſſors and perſecutors of the people of God than theſe: O the ſlavery, the captivity, and the woful miſery of the people of God under thoſe cruel Tyrants! Have not the <hi>Nimrods,</hi> the <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars,</hi> the <hi>Belſhazzars,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders,</hi> and the <hi>Caeſars, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62683:13"/>been commonly the Lords of the world? and who ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably wicked as theſe? no men for wickedneſſe have been able tomatch them, or come neer them.</p>
            <p>It hath been long ſince ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to my hand,
<note place="margin">Dan. 7.</note> that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſets forth the ſeveral Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of the World by ſundry ſorts of cruel beaſts, to ſhew that as they were gotten by beaſtly ſubtilty and cruelty, ſo they were ſupported and maintained by brutiſh ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, craft, and tyranny.</p>
            <p>I have read of a <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> that ſaid, that they well deſerved death that did but quench Tyranny, they ſhould quite have conſumed it with fire: But whether he hit the mark, or mist it, let the
<pb facs="tcp:62683:14"/>Reader judge. Well, Sirs, you may be the Lords of this world, and yet you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be miſerable in another world, except you get God for your portion. The top of mans happineſſe in this world lies in his having of God for his portion. He that hath God for his portion, enjoyes all; and he that wants an intereſt and propriety in God, enjoyes nothing at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I have read of an Heathen, who ſeeing a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Shipwrack of all his wealth, ſaid, Well, Fortune, I ſee now that thou wouldeſt have me to be a <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> O that you would ſay under all your heavie loſſes and croſſes: well, we now ſee that God would have us lay up treaſure in heaven,
<note place="margin">Matth. 6.19, 20.</note> we now ſee that
<pb facs="tcp:62683:14"/>God would have us look after a better portion than any this world affords; we now ſee that it highly concerns us to ſecure our intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in God; we now ſee, that to enjoy God for our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the one thing neceſſary. Have not many of you ſaid, nay ſworne, That if you might but ſee &amp; enjoy the delight of your eyes, that then you ſhould have a ſweeping Trade, and abound in all plenty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and grow rich and great, and glorious in the world, and be eaſed of everie thing that did but look like a burthen, &amp;c. If it be indeed thus with you, why do you ſo complain, murmur, and repine? and why do many of you walk up and down the <hi>Exchange</hi> and ſtreets with tears in your
<pb facs="tcp:62683:15"/>eyes, and with heavineſſe in your hearts, and with crack't credits, and thread-bare coats, and empty purſes? and why are ſo many of you broke, and ſo manie priſoners, and ſo manie hid, and ſo manie fled? But if it be otherwiſe, and that you are ſenſible that you have put a cheat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelves (I ſay not upon others) and that as you have been ſelf-flatterers, ſo you have been ſelf-deceivers, the more highly it concernes you to do your ſelves, your ſouls that right, as to make ſure God for your portion: For what elſe can make up thoſe woful diſappointments under which you are fallen.</p>
            <p>It is a ſad ſight to ſee all the arrows that men ſhoot to fall upon their own heads, or
<pb facs="tcp:62683:15"/>to ſee men twiſt a cord to hang themſelves, or to ſee men dig a pit for others, and to fall into it themſelves; and it tis but juſtice that men ſhould bake as they brew, and that they which brew miſchief ſhould have the firſt and the largeſt draught of it themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now the beſt way to prevent ſo ſad a ſight, and ſo great a miſchief, is to get God for your portion: for when once God comes to be a mans portion, <hi>then all things ſhall work together for his good,</hi> Rom. <hi>8.28.</hi> and then God will preſerve him from ſuch hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miſchievous actings. The whole World is a great <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and multitudes there are that think madly, and that deſign madly, and that talk madly, and that act madly,
<pb facs="tcp:62683:16"/>and that walk madly. Now as you would not be found in the number of thoſe <hi>Bedlams,</hi> it highly concerns you to get God for your portion, that ſo you may be filled with that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that may preſerve you from the follie and madneſſe of this mad world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> The following <hi>Sermons</hi> I preached in the year <hi>1660.</hi> at <hi>Olaves Breadſtreet,</hi> and God bleſt them then to thoſe Chriſtians that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my Miniſtry, and I hope he will bleſſe them alſo to the internal and eternal welfare of your ſouls to whom they are now dedicated. They are much inlarged; the profit will be yours, the labour hath been mine: I judge them very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and ſuitable to preſent diſpenſations, elſe they had
<pb facs="tcp:62683:16"/>not ſee the light at this time. Curioſity is the ſpiritual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery of the ſoul; curioſity is that green-ſickneſſe of the ſoul, whereby it longs for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, and loaths ſound and wholſome truths; it is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical diſtemper of this age and hour.</p>
            <p>And therefore if any of you are troubled with this itch of curioſity, and love to be wiſe above what is written, and delight to ſcan the choice my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Religion by carnal reaſon, and affect elegant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Seraphical noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the flowers of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, more than ſound and wholſome <hi>Truths,</hi> then you may eaſe your ſelves (if you pleaſe) of the trouble of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this following Treatiſe; onely remember this, that the
<pb facs="tcp:62683:17"/>prudent Husband-man looks more and delights more in the ripeneſſe, and ſoundneſſe, and goodneſſe of the Corn that is in his Field, than he doth at the beauty of the Cockle; and remember, that no man can live more miſerably than he that lives altogether upon Sawces; and he that looks more at the handſomneſſe than he doth at the wholſomneſſe of the Diſhes of Meat that are ſet before him, may well paſſe for a fool.</p>
            <p>Well, Gentlemen, for a Cloſe remember this, that as <hi>Noah</hi> was drunk with his own wine, and as <hi>Goliah</hi> was beheaded by his own ſword, and as the roſe is deſtroyed by the canker that it breeds in it ſelf, and as <hi>Agrippina</hi> was killed by <hi>Nero,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62683:17"/>to whom ſhe gave breath; ſo if ever you are eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, you will be deſtroyed by your ſelves; if ever you are undone, you will be undone by your ſelves; if ever you are ſcourged to death, it will be by rods of your own making, and if ever the bitter cup of damnation be put into your hands, it will be found to be of your own preparing, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, and imbittering.</p>
            <p>Behold, I have ſet life and death, heaven and hell, glory and miſery before you in this Treatiſe: and therefore if you will needs chuſe death rather than life, hell rather than heaven, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery rather than glory:
<pb facs="tcp:62683:18"/>What can be more just than that you ſhould periſh to all eternity. If you will not have God for your portion, you ſhall be ſure to have wrath for your portion, and hell for your portion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Well Sirs, remember this at laſt, every man ſhall onely thank his own folly for his own bane, his own ſin, for his own everlaſting ſhame, his own iniquity, for his own endleſſe miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have now no more to do, but to improve all the intereſt that I have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, That this Treatiſe

            <p>Firſt, an Aſſertion, or Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in thoſe words, <hi>The Lord is my portion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, A proof of it, in thoſe words, <hi>Saith my ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The uſe or inference from the premiſes, in thoſe words, <hi>Therefore will I hope in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words being thus opened, the Propoſition that I intend to inſiſt upon, is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That the Lord is the Saints portion,

               </label> the Lord is the believers portion.</q>
            <p>I ſhall call in a few Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to witneſſe to the truth of this Propoſition, and then I ſhall further open it to you. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of my cup: thou maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt my lot.</hi> Pſal. 73.26. <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62683:23"/>Pſ. 119.57. <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord, I have ſaid that I would keep thy words.</hi> Jer. 10.16. <hi>The portion of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob is not like them; for he is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of all things, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>is the Rod of his inheritance; the Lord of Hoſts is his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the further opening and clearing up of this great and glorious, this ſweet and bleſſed truth, I ſhall indeavour to ſhew you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what a portion the Lord is to his Saints, to his gracious ones. And.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the reaſons or grounds whereupon the Saints have laid claim to God, as their portion.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, What a portion God is. Now the excellency of this portion I ſhall ſhew you, by an induction of particulars thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, God is a preſent portion, he is a portion in hand, he is a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in poſſeſſion;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 48.14. Iſa. 25.9.</note> all the Scriptures that are c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>God is a very preſent help in trouble.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Betſaroth</hi> is in the plurall number,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour was ſo delighted with that ſentence of <hi>Paul, Si Deus nobiſcum,</hi> If God be with us, who ſhall be againſt us? that he cauſed it to be written upon the Walls in moſt rooms of his Palace.</note> 
               <hi>troubles,</hi> that is, <hi>God is a preſent help in many troubles,</hi> in great troubles, and in continued troubles. <hi>Betſaroth</hi> is from <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>I for,</hi> that ſignifies to ſtraiten, and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beſiege, it notes the extremity of affliction and trouble. When the people of God are in their greateſt extremity, then God will be a preſent help, a preſent portion to them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the Rivens, they ſhall not overflow thee; when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> God will be a preſent help, a preſent relief, a preſent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, a preſent comfort, a preſent portion to his people, in all thoſe great and various trials that they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62683:24"/>may be exerciſed under. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.5. <hi>I cried unto thee, O Lord; I ſaid, thou art my refuge, and my portion in the land of the living.</hi> God is a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in preſent poſſeſſion, and not a portion in reverſion; the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt doth not ſay, Thou mayeſt be my portion in another world, but <hi>Thou art my portion in the land of the living:</hi> nor he doth not ſay, Thou wilt be my portion in another world, but <hi>Thou are my portion in the land of the living.</hi> Look, as <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kanah</hi> gave <hi>Hannah</hi> a worthy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in hand,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.5.</note> ſo God gives himſelf to his Saints, as a worthy portion in hand: Many men wait, and wait long for their earthly porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before they enjoy them, yea, their patience is oftentimes wore ſo thread-bare in waiting, that they wiſh their parents in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, I, and ſometimes in a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer place, that ſo they may inherit their Honours, Lordſhips, Lands, Treaſures, &amp;c. Look, as a bird in the hand is worth two, I, ten in the buſh; ſo a portion in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62683:24"/>is worth two, I, ten in reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now God is a portion in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion, and that ſpeaks out the excellency of the Saints porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As he in <hi>Piatarch</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> that although they had no muſick, nor vines among them, yet (as a better thing) they had gods. So I may ſay, though the Saints have not this, nor that, nor the other earthly portion among them, yet (as a better thing) they have God for their preſent por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and what can they deſire more? But</p>
            <p>Secondly, As God is a preſent portion, ſo God is an immenſe portion, he is a vaſt, large portion, he is the greateſt portion of all portions: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Which in his times he ſhall ſhew, who is the bleſſed and onely Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Theſe words are a ſtately and lofty deſcription of the greatneſs of God: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle heapeth up many words to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſhew, that in greatneſſe God excels all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15, 16, 17. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62683:25"/>the Nations are as a drop of a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, &amp; are counted as the ſmall duſt of the ballance: Behold, he taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing. And</hi> Lebanon <hi>is not ſufficient to burn, nor the beaſts thereof ſufficient for a burnt offering. All Nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſſe than nothing, and vanity.</hi> Not onely one Nation, but many Nations; yea, not onely many Nations, but all Nations, in compariſon of God, are but as the drop of a bucket; and what's leſſer than a drop? and as the ſmall duſt of a ballance; and what's of lighter weight and leſſer worth than the ſmall duſt or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ballance that hangs on the ſcale, and yet never alters the weight? yea, they are nothing, they are leſſe than nothing. And though <hi>Lebanon</hi> was a very great ſpacious Forreſt, and had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of beaſts in it, yet God was a God of that infinite greatneſſe, that though all the beaſts harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that ſtately Forreſt ſhould be ſlain, and all the wood growing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62683:25"/>on it cut down to burn them with it, all would not make up a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice any wayes anſwerable or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his greatneſſe with whom they had to do: and ſo in that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.5. <hi>Great is our Lord, and of great power; his underſtanding is infinite,</hi> or as the Hebrew hath it, <hi>of his underſtanding there is no number.</hi> Such is his greatneſs, that he knows not onely all kinds and ſorts of things, but even all particulars, though they exceed all number: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.3. <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed, and his greatneſs is unſearchable,</hi> or as the Hebrew hath it, <hi>of his greatneſs there is no ſearch.</hi> God is infinitely above all names, all notions, all conceptions, all expreſſions, and all parallels: <hi>Pſa.</hi> 150.2. <hi>Praiſe him for his mighty acts, praiſe him according to his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent greatneſs,</hi> or greatneſſe of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or abundance of greatneſſe, or according to the multitude of his greatneſſe, as the Hebrew and Greek carries it: and ſo in that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17. <hi>For the Lord your God is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62683:26"/>God of Gods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In <hi>Daniel</hi> God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>El E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim,</hi> the mighty of mighties.</note> 
               <hi>and Lord of Lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not perſons, nor taketh reward.</hi> God is the original cauſe of all greatneſs; all that greatneſs that is in any created beings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are Angels, or men, is from God; all their greatneſſe is but a beam of his Sun, a drop out of his Sea, a mite out of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.</note> God is a God of that infinite greatneſſe, that he fills heaven and earth with his preſence, he is every where, and yet circumſcribed to no place, he is in all things, and without all things, and above all things, and this ſpeaks out his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity. <hi>Job</hi> had a very large portion, before God made a breach upon him,
<note place="margin">Job 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>He had ſeven thouſand ſheep, and three thouſand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſhe-aſſes, and a very great houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;</hi> but at laſt God gives him twice as much as he had firſt,
<note place="margin">Job 42.12.</note> 
               <hi>for he had fourteen thouſand ſheep, and ſix thouſand camels, and a thouſand yoke of oxen, and a thouſand ſhe-aſſes.</hi> Cattle
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62683:26"/>are onely inſtanced in, becauſe the wealth of that Countrey conſiſted eſpecially in cattel; but yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Job</hi> had a great many other good things, as goods, lands, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and ſtately habitations; but what is all this to a Saints por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? certainly, had not <hi>Job</hi> had God for his portion, he had been but a rich fool, a golden beaſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the great things that God had heaped upon him. And ſo <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> had a very large portion,
<note place="margin">Eſth. 1.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>he reigned from</hi> India <hi>unto</hi> Ethiopia <hi>over an hundred and ſeven and twenty Provinces,</hi> but what were all his Provinces; but as ſo many handfuls of duſt, in compariſon of the Saints portion? The whole Turkiſh Empire, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> is but a cruſt that God throws to a dog: had a man all the world for his portion, it would be but a poor pittance. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great portion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>O thou King, the moſt high God gave thy father</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>a Kingdome, and majeſty, and glory, and honour.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62683:27"/>And for the majeſty that he gave him, all people, Nations, and languages trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and feared before him: whom he would he ſlew, and whom he would he kept alive, and whom he would he ſet up, and whom he would he put down.</hi> And ſo in that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>I have made the earth, the man, and the beaſt that are upon the ground,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Jer. 28.14.</note>

                  </gap> unto me. And now have I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all theſe lands into the hand of</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>my ſervant, and the beaſts of the field have I given him alſo to ſerve him. And all Nations ſhall ſerve him, and his ſon, and his ſons ſon, until the very time of his land come; and then many Nations and great Kings ſhall ſerve themſelves of him. And it ſhall come to paſs, that the Nation and Kingdome which will not ſerve the ſame</hi> Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar <hi>the King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>that Nation will I puniſh, ſaith the Lord, with the ſword, and with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62683:27"/>the famine, and with the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, until I have conſumed them by his hand.</hi> The portion that here God gives to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is a wonderful large portion; and yet all theſe Nations that God gave to him, were but as ſo many molehils, or as ſo many birds neſts, compared with a Saints portion. All Nations are but as a drop of a bucket (that may in a moment be wip't off with a finger) in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of God, nay, they are all nothing; but that word is too high, for they are leſſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: had a man as many worlds at his command as there be men on earth, or Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet they would be but as ſo many drops, or as ſo many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes to a Saints portion.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alc biades</hi> was proudly boaſting of his lands that lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Socrates</hi> wittily rebukes his pride, by bringing him a Map of the world, and wiſhing him to ſhew him where his lands did lie; his lands would hardly amount to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62683:28"/>more than the prick of a pin; <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are but three little ſpots, to the vaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents that be in other parts of the world; and what then is thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, thy lordſhips, thy mannors, thy farme, thy houſe, thy cottage, but a little <hi>minum,</hi> but a prick of a pin to God, who is ſo great, ſo vaſt a portion? O Sirs, had you the underſtanding of all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven, and the tongues of all the men on earth, yet you would not be able to conceive, expreſs, or ſet forth the greatneſſe and largeneſſe of a Saints portion; Can you tell the ſtars of heaven, or number the ſands of the ſea, or ſtop the Sun in his courſe, or raiſe the dead, or make a new world? then, and not till then will you be able to declare what a great, what an immenſe portion God is: <hi>If eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man</hi> to conceive the great things that God hath laid up in the Goſpel, (for ſo that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62683:28"/>Oh how much leſs then are they able to declare the great things that God hath laid up for his people in another world? But</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As God is an immenſe portion, a large portion, ſo God is an all-ſufficient portion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>And when</hi> Abram <hi>was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram, <hi>and ſaid unto him, I am the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. I am God almighty,</hi> or as ſome carry the words, <hi>I am God all-ſufficient,</hi> or <hi>ſelf-ſufficient:</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62683:29"/>and I will be thy exceeding great reward to ſupply thee with all neceſſary and deſirable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and what can a Saint deſire more? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>For the Lord God is a Sun and ſhield; the Lord will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly.</hi> The Sun, which among all inanimate creatures is the moſt excellent, notes all manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, proviſion, and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the ſhield, which among all artificial creatures is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, notes all manner of protection whatſoever; under the name of grace all ſpiritual good is wrapt up; and under the name of glory all eternal good is wrapt up; and under the laſt clauſe, <hi>no good thing will he with-hold,</hi> is wrapt up all temporal good: all put together ſpeaks out God to be an all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient portion. Before the world was made, before Angels or men had a being, God was as bleſſed and as glorious in himſelf as now he is; God is ſuch an all-ſufficient
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62683:29"/>and ſuch an excellent being, that nothing can be added to him to make him more excellent: Man in his beſt eſtate is ſo great a piece of vanity,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.5.</note> that he ſtands in need of a thouſand thouſand things; he needs the air to breath in, the earth to bare him, and fire to warm him, and cloathes to cover him, and an houſe to ſhelter him, and food to nouriſh him, and a bed to eaſe him, and friends to comfort him, &amp;c. But this is the excellency of God, that he hath all excellencies in himſelf, and ſtands in need of nothing. Were there as many worlds as there are men in the world, and were all thoſe worlds full of bleſſed Saints, yea, were there as many Heavens as there are ſtars in heaven, and were all thoſe heavens full of glorious Angels, yet all theſe Saints; and Angels together could not adde the leaſt to God; for what can drops taken out of the Sea adde unto the Sea? what can finite creatures adde to an infinite being?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62683:30"/>though all the men in the world ſhould praiſe the Sun, and ſay, the Sun is a glorious creature, yet all this would adde nothing to the light and glory of the Sun; ſo, though all the Saints and Angels ſhall be bleſſing, and praiſing, and admiring, and worſhipping of God to all eternity, yet they ſhall never be able to adde any thing to God, who is bleſſed for ever. O Chriſtians, God is an all-ſufficient portion, his power is all-ſufficient to protect you, his wiſdome is all-ſufficient to direct you, his mercy is all-ſufficient to pardon you, his goodneſſe is all-ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for you, his word is all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupport you and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then you, and his grace is all-ſufficient to adorn you and enrich you, and his ſpirit is all-ſufficient to lead you and comfort you; and what can you deſire more? O Sirs, God hath within himſelf all the good of Angels, of men and univerſal nature; he hath all glory, all dignity, all riches, all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62683:30"/>treaſures, all pleaſures,
<note place="margin">God is <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnia ſuper omnia,</hi> and many of the very heathens counted God <hi>Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> the beſt and greateſt.</note> all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, all comforts, all contents, all joyes, all beatitudes in himſelf. All the ſcattered excellencies and perfections that be in the creatures are eminently, tranſcendently, and perfectly in him. Look as the worth and value of many pieces of ſilver are contracted in one piece of gold; ſo all the whole vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of perfections which is ſpread through heaven and earth are epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomized in God, according to that old ſaying, <hi>Omne bonum in ſummo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> all good is in the chiefeſt good. God is one infinite perfection in himſelf, which is eminently and virtually all perfections of the creatures: all the good, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, the beauty, and glory that is in all created beings, are but parts of that whole that is in God; and all the good that is in them is borrowed and derived from God, who is the firſt cauſe, and the univerſal cauſe of all that good that is in Angels or men. God is a ſufficient portion to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62683:31"/>your ſouls, and to ſupply all your wants, and to ſatisfie all your deſires, and to anſwer all your expectations, and to ſuppreſſe all your enemies, and after all to bring you to glory; and what can you deſire more?</p>
            <p>But now all earthly portions are inſufficient portions, they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevent afflictions, nor ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſoul under afflictions, nor mitigate afflictions, nor yet deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a man from afflictions: They can neither arm the ſoul againſt temptations, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the ſoul under temptations,
<note place="margin">A golden crown cannot cure the head-ach, nor a purple robe cannot fray away a burning ſeaver, nor a bed of gold cannot give eaſe to a diſtempered body, nor the velvet ſlipper cannot take away the pain of the gout.</note> nor lead the ſoul out of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. All the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world are but as ſo many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers without God; when God frowns, all the creatures in the world are not ſufficient to chear the ſoul, when God withdraws, all the creatures in the world are not ſufficient to ſuſtain the ſoul; when God clouds
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62683:31"/>his face, all the creatures in the world are not ſufficient to make it day with the ſoul, &amp;c. There is not enough in the whole creation to content, quiet, or ſatisfie one immortal ſoul; he that hath moſt of the world would have more, and he that hath leaſt of the world hath enough, if his ſoul can but groundedly ſay, <hi>The Lord is my portion.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As the Lord is an all-ſufficient portion, ſo the Lord is a moſt abſolute, needful, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary portion; the want of an earthly portion may trouble me, but the want of God for my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will damn me; 'tis not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that I ſhould have a portion in gold, or ſilver, or jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, or goods, or lands; but 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary that I ſhould have God for my portion. I may have union and communion with God,

But</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> As the Lord is a moſt abſolute, needful, and neceſſary portion, ſo the Lord is a pure and unmixed portion, God is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed good, he hath nothing in him but goodneſſe; he is an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of ſweetneſſe, without one drop of bitterneſſe;
<note place="margin">Deut. 32.4. Hab. 1.13.</note> he is a perfect beauty, without the leaſt ſpot or ſhadow of deformity. All other portions are a bitter ſweet; but God is a Roſe without prickles, he is a good, in which there is not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62683:35"/>the leaſt evil. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all.</hi> There are no mixtures in God, God is a moſt clear bright ſhining light, yea, he is all light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all. God is all light, and all love, all ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all goodneſſe, all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and all graciouſneſſe, and there is no uncomlineſs, no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovelineſſe, no bitterneſſe nor no darkneſs at all in God. The Moon when it ſhines brighteſt hath her dark ſpots and ſpecks; but God is a light that ſhines moſt gloriouſly without the leaſt ſpot or ſpeck; God is a moſt pure, clear, ſplendid light. 'Tis very obſervable, that the Apoſtle, to illuſtrate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect purity of God, adds a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his Affirmative, <hi>in him is no darkneſſe at all;</hi> that is, God is ſo pure, that not the leaſt ſpot, the ſmalleſt ſpeck of vanity or folly can cleave to him: God is a pure, a moſt pure act, without the leaſt potentiality, defectability, or mutability, and therefore in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62683:35"/>higheſt ſenſe <hi>he is light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all.</hi> By this Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical deſcription of God the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would not have us think, that the nature of God is changed into the nature of light; but by this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude the Apoſtle would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſomething of the purity and excellency of God to us. The Sun is light, the Moon is light, and the Stars are light; but it would be blaſphemy for us to imagine, that the eſſence of God is the ſame with this of the creatures: but this Sirs you muſt remember, that there are many excellent proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of light, for which God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scripture reſembled to light. As</p>
            <p>Firſt, light is pure,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and ſo is God, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity.</hi> There are four things that God cannot do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He cannot lie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He cannot die.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He cannot deny himſelf, nor</p>
            <p n="4">4. He cannot look with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62683:36"/>eye upon iniquity: he is a God of that infinite purity, that he can't look upon iniquity, but with an hateful eye, an angry eye, a revengeful eye, and with a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive eye.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> All things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to the light, and ſo they are to God:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.12. 1 Sam. 2.1, 3 Pſal. 16.8. Pſ. 119.168. God is <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus oculus,</hi> all eye. <hi>Athenodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> an heathen could ſay, that God was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held all that was done.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Neither is there any creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to doe.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is a Metaphor, ſay ſome, that is taken from the Prieſts under the Law, who when they killed the beaſts for ſacrifice, all things that were within the beaſts were laid naked and bare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prieſt, that ſo he might ſee what was ſound, and what was corrupted. Others ſay, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle alludes to the anatomizing of ſuch creatures, wherein men are very cautious and curious to finde out every little vein or muſcle, though they lie never ſo cloſe:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62683:36"/>others ſay, that 'tis a Metaphor taken from thoſe that lie with their faces upwards, that all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers may ſee who they are. All agree in this, that all mens in ſides and out-ſides are anatomized, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected, quartered, and laid naked to the eye of God, <hi>Job</hi> 34.21, 22. <hi>For his eyes are upon the wayes of man, and he ſeeth all his goings: There is no darkneſſe, nor ſhadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> If thou canſt not bide thy ſelf from the Sun, which is Gods Miniſter of light, how impoſſible will it be to hide thy ſelf from him whoſe eyes are ten thouſand times brighter than the Sun, ſaith <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Without light nothing can be ſeen; ſo without the beams of heavenly light no heavenly things can be ſeen: a man cannot ſee God, but in that light that comes down from above; a man cannot ſee Chriſt without he be firſt inlightened by Chriſt;
<note place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note> a man cannot ſee heaven, but in that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62683:37"/>light that comes from heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 12, 14, 15, 16. Were it not for the Sun it would be perpetual night in the world, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the Torches that could be lighted, yea, notwithſtanding all the light of the Moon and Stars: ſo it would be perpetual night with poor ſouls, notwithſtanding all the torch-light of natural parts, and creature-comforts, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Star-light of civil honeſty and common gifts, and notwithſtanding all the Moon-light of temporary faith and formal profeſſion, did not the Sun of righteouſneſſe ariſe and ſhine upon them. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> There is nothing more pleaſant than the light, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Truly the light is ſweet, and 'tis a very pleaſant thing to behold the Sun.</hi> A Philoſopher being ask't whether it were not a pleaſant thing to behold the Sun? anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that that was a blind mans queſtion, becauſe life without light is but a life-leſſe life. Now as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62683:37"/>there is nothing more pleaſant and delightful to the eye than light, ſo there is nothing more pleaſant and delightful to the ſoul than God. The poor Northern Nations in <hi>Strabo</hi> that want the light of the Sun for ſome moneths together, when the term of his return ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, they climb up into the higheſt mountains to ſpie it, and he that ſpies it firſt was accounted the beſt and moſt beloved of God, they choſe him King almoſt as the <hi>Tyrians</hi> did <hi>Strato.</hi> Now the return of the Sun is not more pleaſant and delightful to thoſe poor Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations, than God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful to all gracious ſouls. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The light ſhines and ſcatters its rays over all the world, over Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South; and ſo doth the preſence and goodneſſe of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. But.</p>
            <p>Sixthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The light is a creature of a moſt reſplendent beauty, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, and glory, it dazles the eyes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62683:38"/>of the beholders; and ſo God is a God of that tranſcendent beauty, majeſty, and glory, that the very eyes of the Angels are dazled, as not being able to behold the brightneſs of his glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.2. God dwells in that light, which no man can approach unto. But</p>
            <p>Seventhly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and laſtly, the light of all bodies is the moſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound light, it will never mix with darkneſſe; no more will God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>What communion hath light with darkneſſe?</hi> the nature of God is void of all compoſition, light expells darkneſs, it never mixes nor mingles with it. By what hath been ſaid, you ſee that God is a pure, and an unmixed light, and that in him there is no darkneſs at all.</p>
            <p>But now all worldly portions are mixt with many troubles, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, cares, fears, hazards, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, vexations, oppoſitions, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, loſſes, and often times with many gripes of conſcience too.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62683:38"/>All earthly portions are mixt portions,

               </note> wherefore, or with what hiſtorical alluſion he did ſo is uncertain; but ſurely it was to imply thus much, that great places are not free from great cares, that no man
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62683:39"/>knows the weight of a Scepter, but he that ſwayes it: This made <hi>Saul</hi> to hide himſelf amongſt the ſtuff, when he ſhould have been made King; many a ſleepleſſe night, many a reſtleſſe day, many a ſad temptation, and many a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſhift will their ambition coſt them that affect ſuch places of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency. Beſides, high places are commonly very ſlippery, he that ſtands in them may ſuddenly fall, and wound his conſcience, or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily fall and break his neck. But</p>
            <p>Sixthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> As God is a pure and unmixed portion, ſo he is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a happy, and a bleſſed porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.5, 6.</note> he is ſo in himſelf, and he makes them ſo too who enjoy him for their portion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the nation whoſe God is the Lord, and the people whom he hath choſen for his own inheritance.</hi> All the happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe of the people of God ſtands in this that God is their God, and that he is their portion, and that they are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62683:39"/>his inheritance. The Hebrew word <hi>Aſhre.</hi> (that is here rendered <hi>bleſſed</hi>) is, O the bleſſedneſſel or, O the heaped up happineſs of thoſe whoſe God is the Lord! the happineſs of ſuch is ſo great, and ſo glorious, as cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as cannot be uttered: the words are a joyful acclamation for their felicity that have God for their portion. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 144.15. <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that people that is in ſuch a caſe, yea happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord. David</hi> having prayed for many temporal bleſſings in the behalf of the people, from <hi>ver.</hi> 12. to <hi>ver.</hi> 15. at laſt concludes, <hi>Bleſſed are the people that are in ſuch a caſe;</hi> but preſently he checks and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects himſelf, and eats (as it were) his own words, but rather <hi>happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord:</hi> The Syriack rendereth it queſtion-wiſe, <hi>Is not the people that is in ſuch a caſe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">P ſal. 146.5</note> the anſwer is <hi>No,</hi> except they have God to boot. Nothing can make that man truly miſerable that hath God for his portion, nor nothing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62683:40"/>can make that man truly happy that wants God for his portion. God is the Author of all true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, he is the donor of all true happineſs, he is the maintainer of all true happineſs, and he is the center of all true happineſs and bleſſedneſs; and therefore he that hath him for his God, for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the onely happy man in the world.</p>
            <p>But now all earthly portions cannot make a man truly happy and bleſſed; a Crown, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cannot,
<note place="margin">If a man ſhould make a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical enquiry after true happineſſe, from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Angel in heaven to the loweſt worm on earth, the joynt voice of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would be, that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not in them.</note> for <hi>Saul</hi> and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have found it ſo; Honours cannot, for <hi>Haman</hi> and others have found it ſo; A high and noble birth cannot, for <hi>Abſalom, Ammon,</hi> and others have found it ſo; Riches cannot, for the rich fool in the Goſpel and many thouſand others have found it ſo; Large Dominions, and great commands cannot, for <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus,

            <p>God is a univerſal portion, all things receive their being, eſſence, and exiſtence from him, for the fulneſſe of all things is in him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and eminently. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers of old called God <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">Theſe things I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly handled more largely, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a touch here muſt ſuffice, &amp;c.</note> he is a portion that none can cheat or ſpoil you of; God is ſuch a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that no friend, no foe, no man, no enemy, no Devil can ever rob a Chriſtian of.

It muſt be a power that muſt over-match the power of God, and a ſtrength that muſt be above the ſtrength of God that muſt rob or ſpoil a Chriſtian of his portion; but who is there that is ſtronger than God?

            <p>Twelfthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> As God is an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible portion, ſo God is an inexhauſtible portion, a portion that can never be ſpent, that can never be exhauſted, a fountain that ſtill overflows, a rich Myne that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62683:55"/>hath no bottome, a Spring that can never be drawn dry, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues alwayes full without aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or diminution: <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>But whoſoever drinketh of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I ſhall give him ſhall never thirſt; but the water that I ſhall give him ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up unto everlaſting life.</hi> If grace in the ſoul be ſuch a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual flowing fountain, that it ſhall never be exhauſted till grace be ſwallowed up in glory; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the God of grace is much more an inexhauſtible Fountaine that can never be drawn dry. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Saints,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.16, 17</note> and ſinners have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon this portion almoſt this ſix thouſand years, and it is not in the leaſt diminiſhed. God hath his City-houſe, and his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where millions have been kept at his table, and lived upon his purſe, his charge, even dayes without number, and yet God is not one penny the poorer for all this. This portion is like the meal in the Barrel, and the oil in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62683:56"/>the Cruſe, which never failed: 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.14, 16. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the barrel of meal ſhall not waſte, neither ſhall the Cruſe of oil fail, until the day that the Lord ſendeth rain upon the Earth: And the Barrel of meal waſted not, neither did the Cruſe of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord which he spake by</hi> Elijah. God is ſuch a portion as cannot be waſted nor diminiſhed; he is ſuch a portion as can never fail: Should all Chriſtians now live to the age of the Patriarchs, who lived many hundred years, and ſhould they all live freely, and keep open houſe every day in the year, yet at the end, not a dram, not a penny, no not a farthing of this portion will be expended or diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>Though men have never ſo great a ſtock, yet if they ſtill ſpend upon it they wil certainly conſume it; O but God is ſuch a ſtock as can never be ſpent, as can never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. If a ſparrow ſhould but fetch a drop of water out of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62683:56"/>Sea once a day, yea, once in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, yet in time it would be exhauſted; O but God is ſuch a Sea, ſuch an Ocean, that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Angel in heaven, and every Saint and ſinner on earth ſhould drink whole Rivers at a draught, yet not one drop could be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: If a child ſhould but take a cockle-ſhell of water out of the Sea every day, the Sea would be really the leſſe, though not viſibly the leſſe, and in time it would be exhauſted, and drawn dry; but let all created beings be every day a drawing from God, yet they ſhall never leſſen him, they ſhall never draw him dry. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breaſts are often drawn dry, but the more you draw at the breaſts of God, the more the milk of grace and comfort will flow in upon you: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.10, 11. <hi>Rejoyce ye with</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and be glad with her, all ye that love her; rejoyce for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: That ye may ſuck and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of her conſolation, that you
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62683:57"/>may milk out and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</hi> God keeps o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen houſe for all commers and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.24.</note> for all created creatures both in heaven and earth; and though they are perpetually a ſucking at his breaſts, yet the more they draw the more the heavenly milk of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine joy, content, and ſatisfaction flows in abundantly upon them: All creatures, both high and low, rich and poor, honourable and baſe, noble and ignoble, bond and free, Jews and Gentiles, are all maintained upon Gods own coſt and charge, they are all fed at his Table, and maintained by what comes out of his Treaſury, his purſe; and yet God is not a pin the poorer for all this: It would break and beggar all the Princes on earth to keep but one day the leaſt part of that innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that God feeds, and cloaths, and cheriſhes, and maintains every day upon the account of his own Revenue, which is never the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for all the vaſt expences that he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62683:57"/>is daily at. There is ſtill in God a fulneſſe of abundance, and a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of redundance, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the vaſt ſummes that he hath and daily doth expend. It were blaſphemy to think that God ſhould be a penny the poorer by all that he hath laid out for the maintenance of thoſe millions of Angels and men that have had their dependance upon him, from their firſt creation to this very day. Look, as the Sun hath never the leſſe light for filling the Stars with light, and as the Fountain hath never the leſſe water for filling the leſſer Veſſels with water that are about it; ſo though God fills all the Veſſels both of grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with his own fulneſſe, yet he is never the leſſe full himſelf; there is ſtill in God <hi>(plenitudo fontis)</hi> the fulneſſe of a Fountain. Look, as the overflowing Fountain pours out water abundantly, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all it remains full; ſo though the Lord be ſuch an overflowing Fountain as that he fills all, yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62683:58"/>ſtill he retains all fulneſſe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>I have read of a Spaniſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, that coming to ſee the Treaſury of Saint <hi>Mark</hi> in <hi>Venice</hi> that is ſo much cried up in the world, he fell a groping at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Cheſts and Trunks to ſee whether they had any bottom; and being asked the reaſon, why he did ſo? anſwered in this among other things, My Maſters Treaſure differs from yours, and excells yours, in that his hath no bottome as yours have, alluding to the Mynes in <hi>Mexico, Peru,</hi> and other parts of the Weſtern <hi>India.</hi> All mens Mints, Bags, Purſes, and Coffers may be quickly exhauſted and drawn dry, but God is ſuch an inexhauſtible portion that he can never be drawn dry: all Gods Treaſures are bottomleſſe, and all his Mints are bottomleſſe, and all his Bags are bottomleſſe; milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thouſands in heaven and earth ſeed every day upon him, and yet he ſeels it not, he is ſtill a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62683:58"/>giving, and yet his purſe is never empty; he is ſtill a filling all the Court of heaven, and all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on earth, and yet he is a Fountain that ſtill overflowes. There be them that ſay, that 'tis moſt certainly true of the Oil at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> that though it be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpent in the inauguration of their Kings of <hi>France,</hi> yet it never waſts; but whatever truth is in this ſtory, of this I am moſt ſure, that though all the creatures in both worlds live and ſpend conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on Chriſts ſtock, yet it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver waſteth.</p>

Now did any man enjoy what he is ſaid to deſire, it would be but a very mean portion compared with God: we may truly ſay of all the honours, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, greatneſſe, grandure and glory of this world, compared with God, as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſometimes ſaid of the Vintage of <hi>Abiezer,</hi> The glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of <hi>Ephraim</hi> are better than the Vintage of <hi>Abiezer;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 8.2.</note> ſo the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gleanings, yea, the ſmalleſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings of God are far better, and more excellent, and tranſcendent, they are more ſatisfying, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting, more raviſhing, more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62683:72"/>quieting, and more contenting than all earthly portions are, or can be: What compariſon is there between a drop of a bucket, and the vaſt Ocean? between a weak drop, which recollecting all its force, yet hath not ſtrength enough to fall, and the mighty waters? or what compariſon is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the duſt of the ballance and the whole Earth? why, you will ſay, there is no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe things; and I will ſay, there is leſſe between all finite portions, and ſuch an infinite por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as God is: For this is moſt certain, that there muſt needs be alwayes an infinite diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is finite, and what is infinite; and ſuch a portion God is. By all that hath been ſaid, 'tis moſt evident that God is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable portion.</p>
            <p>But now all earthly portions are comparable portions; you may eaſily and ſafely compare one earthly portion with another, one
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62683:72"/>Princes Revenues may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to anothers, and one great mans Lordſhips may be compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to anothers, and one Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants eſtate may be comparable to anothers, and one Gentlemans lands may be comparable to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and one wives portion may be comparable to anothers, and one childs portion may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to anothers, &amp;c. but God is an incomparable portion; there is no compariſon to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and other portions. And thus I have in theſe fifteen particulars fully diſcovered the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Saints portion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other portions.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall now come to the ſecond thing, and that is to ſhew you upon what grounds their title unto God as their portion is founded and bottomed, and they are theſe that follow:</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The free favour and love of God, the good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62683:73"/>of God is the true ground and bottome of Gods beſtowing of himſelf as a portion upon his people;
<note place="margin">Deut. 7.6, 7, 8. Ezek. 16.1. to the 15.</note> there was no lovelineſſe nor comlineſſe in them that ſhould move him to beſtow himſelf upon them; they had neither portion, nor proportion, and therefore there was no cauſe in them why God ſhould beſtow himſelf as a portion upon them. God, for the glory of his own free grace and love, hath beſtowed himſelf as a portion upon thoſe who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have their portion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Devils and damned ſpirits, in thoſe torments that are endleſs, eaſleſs, and remedileſs. The <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> feign, that their Gods and Goddeſſes loved ſome certain Trees, for ſome lovely good that was in them; for <hi>Jupiter</hi> loved the Oak for durance, and <hi>Neptune</hi> the Cedar for ſtature, and <hi>Apollo</hi> the Laurel for greenneſs, and <hi>Venus</hi> the Poplar for whiteneſſe, and <hi>Pallas</hi> the Vine for fruitfulneſs; but what ſhould move the God of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62683:73"/>Gods to love us, who were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, ſo filthy, ſo empty, ſo beggarly, that were Trees indeed, but ſuch as <hi>Jude</hi> mentions, <hi>corrupt, fruitleſſe, twice dead,</hi>

            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Their title to God as their portion, is founded upon Gods free and voluntary donation of himſelf to them in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.
<note place="margin">Ezek. 11.19 Heb. 8.10. to the end, &amp;c.</note> In the Covenant of grace God hath freely beſtowed himſelf upon his people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38, 40. <hi>And they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God. And I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> The Covenant of grace is the great Chapter, 'tis the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of all a Saints ſpiritual priviledges and immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62683:74"/>now in this great Charter the Lord hath proclaimed himſelf to be his peoples God: <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The portion of</hi> Jacob <hi>is the former of all things, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name.</hi> He that is the former of all things, even the Lord of Hoſts, is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and he is <hi>Jacobs</hi> por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by vertue of that Covenant of grace, which is a free, a full, a rich, and an everlaſting Covenant, a Covenant that he will never break, nor alter, nor falſifie, a Covenant that he hath ſworn to may good, as you may ſee by comparing the Scriptures in the Margin together.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.34 Iſa. 54.9, 10. Pſal. 111.5. Pſal. 89.35. Pſal. 105.9 Mic. 7. ult. Heb. 6.13. to the 19. Luke 1.73.</note> That Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, whereby God gives himſelf to be his peoples God and portion, he is bound to make good by his oath; and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whoever is forſworn, God will never be forſworn. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians (though Heathens) ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perjury, that if any man did but ſwear <hi>By the life of the King,</hi> and did not perform his oath, that man was to die, and no gold
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62683:74"/>was to redeem his life, as <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> obſerveth in his Comment on <hi>Geneſis.</hi> To think that God will not make good that Covenant that he hath bound himſelf by Oath to make good, is blaſphemy, yea, it is to debaſe him below the very Heathens. All Lawes, both divine and humane, have left no ſuch bond of aſſurance to tie and faſten one to another, as that of an Oath or Covenant; which as they are to be taken in ſincerity, ſo they are to be kept inviolably. Certainly, the Covenant and Oath of the great God is not like a Cyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies knot that is faſt or looſe at pleaſure: Whoever breaks with him, yet he will be ſure faithfully and inviolably to keep his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and his Oath with his. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Their title to God, as their God and portion,
<note place="margin">Jer. 3.13, 14</note> is founded and bottomed upon that Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-union that is between God and his people; <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.19, 20, 23. <hi>And I will burith thee unto me for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62683:75"/>ever, yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſſe, and in judgment, and in loving kindneſſe; and in mercies. I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulneſſe, and thou ſhalt know the Lord: And I will ſow her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; And I will ſay to them that are not my people, Thou art my people; and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God.</hi> This threefold repetition, <hi>I will betroth thee, I will betroth thee, I will betroth thee,</hi> notes three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The certainty of their Marriage-union and communion with God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The excellency and dignity of their Marriage-union and communion with God. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The difficulty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their Marriage-union and communion with God. There is nothing that Satan doth ſo much envy and oppoſe, as he doth the ſouls Marriage-union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; and therefore God fetches it over again, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and again, <hi>I will betroth thee
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62683:75"/>unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo in that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my ſoul ſhall be joyful in my God; for he hath cloathed me with the garments of ſalvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteouſneſſe, as a bridegroom decketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ornaments,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What was ſaid by one of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Methuſelahs</hi> wife, that ſhe had nine huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in one, is very applicable to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that hath God for his husband.</note> 
               <hi>and as a bride adorneth her ſelf with her jewels.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 62.5. <hi>For as a young man marrieth a Virgin, ſo ſhall thy ſons marry thee; and as a bridegroom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth over the bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee.</hi> I have read of five ſiſters, of the ſame birth, pedigree, and race, whereof one was married to a Knight, another to an Earl, a third to a Gentleman, a fourth to a mean man, and the fifth to a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy beggar; though they were all alike by birth and deſcent, yet their difference did lie in their marriage; we are all alike by creation, by the fall, by nature, and by the firſt birth, 'tis onely our Marriage-union
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62683:76"/>and communion with God that differences us from others, and that exalts and lifts us up above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Look, as the husband is the wives by marriage-union and communion, ſo God is the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers God and portion, by vertue of that marriage-union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that is between God and the believer. And let thus much ſuffice for the ſecond thing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall come now to the third thing, and that is, to make ſome improvement of this bleſſed and glorious truth to our ſelves; and therefore,</p>
            <p>Is it ſo, that God is the Saints portion, and that he is ſuch an excellent, and ſuch a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent portion above all other por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as hath been fully eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? Then,</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Let not the Saints that have God for their portion fret and vex themſelves, becauſe of thoſe earthly portions that God commonly beſtowes upon the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62683:76"/>worſt of men. There is a great aptneſſe in the beſt of men to envy thoſe earthly portions that God often beſtows upon the worſt of men. The lights of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary have burnt dim, ſtars of no ſmall magnitude have twinkled, men of eminent parts, famous in their generations for religion and piety,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſeeing <hi>Harpalus</hi> a vitious perſon ſtill thriving in the world, he was bold to ſay, that wicked <hi>Harpalus</hi> his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long in proſperity, was an argument, that God hath caſt off his care of the world, that he cared not which end went forward; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if this Heathen ſtumbled at the proſperity of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when ſo many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſons of <hi>Zion</hi> have ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that ſtumbling ſtone.</note> have ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſee the flouriſhing eſtate of the wicked; it made <hi>Job</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>Job</hi> 21.7-16. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 24.12. and <hi>Jeremy</hi> to expoſtulate with God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.1, 2. and <hi>David</hi> even to faint and ſink, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. To ſee the proſperity of the ungodly, to ſee the wicked in wealth, and the Saints in want; the wicked in their robes, and the Saints in their rags; the wicked ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62683:77"/>and the Saints deſpiſed; the wicked exalted, &amp; the Saints deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the wicked upon thrones, and Saints upon dunghils, is a ſight that hath ſadly put the beſt of men ſometimes to it: But this is a temper of ſpirit that doth no wayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thoſe that have God for their portion: and therefore the Pſalmiſt in the 37 <hi>Pſalme</hi> cautions the Saints againſt it no leſſe than three ſeveral times, as you may ſee in <hi>v.</hi> 1.7, 8. There is nothing that doth ſo ill become a Saint that hath God for his portion, as to be ſick of the <hi>Frets;</hi> and to prevent this miſchief, this ſickneſs, the precept is doubled, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled, <hi>Fret not, Fret not, Fret not.</hi> Though they that have ſore eyes are offended at bright clear lights, yet they that have God for their portion ſhould never fret or fume, ſtorm or rage, becauſe ſome are greater than they, or richer than they, or higher than they, or more honourable than they, becauſe all all their proſperity is nothing but
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62683:77"/>an unhappy happineſſe, 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a banquet (like <hi>Hamans)</hi> before execution; and what man is there (that is in his wits) that would envy a Malefactor who meets with honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, as he is going along to execution? All a wicked mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate meats, his fine bits, and his murthering morſels are ſawced, and all his pleaſant and delightful drinks are ſpiced with the wrath and diſpleaſure of an angry God; and why then ſhould you fret and vex at their proſperity? what madneſſe and folly would it be in a man that is heir to many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands <hi>per annum,</hi> to envy a Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>player that is cloathed in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a King, but yet not heir to one foot of land, no, nor worth one penny in all the world, and who at night muſt put off his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al apparel, and the next day put on his beggarly habit? Oh Sirs, it will be but a little little while before the great God will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe the wicked of all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62683:78"/>felicity, and worldly glory, and cloath them with the rags of ſhame, ſcorn, and contempt for ever; and therefore, Oh what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and madneſs would it be for thoſe that are heirs of God,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> and joynt heirs with Chriſt of all the glory of heaven to envy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the wicked.</p>
            <p>The proſperity of the wicked layes them open to the worſt and greateſt ſins.</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It layes them open to all uncleanneſſe and filthineſſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7, 8.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It layes them open to pride and contempt of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.3-13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It layes them open to vex, oppreſs, tyrannize, perſecute, inſult, and triumph over the poor people of God, as you may ſee in <hi>Pharaoh, Saul, Ahab, Jezabel, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and the Scribes and Phati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> It layes them open to a neglect and ſlighting of the wayes of God, and of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62683:78"/>of God, <hi>Job</hi> 21.5-16. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. When the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> were in their proſperity, they ſlighted powerful Preaching, &amp;c. and began to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a vain frothy way of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and living, which uſhered in the maſſacre upon them. <hi>Moulin</hi> hit it, when ſpeaking of the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, he ſaid, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts hurt us and perſecute us for reading the Scriptures, we burn with zeal to be reading of them; but now perſecution is over, our Bibles are like old Almanacks.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> It layes them open to a ſtupidneſſe, unmindfulneſſe, and forgetfulneſſe of the afflictions of the People of God, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1-8. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> chief Butler was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſet down in the ſeat of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but quite contrary to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he eaſily forgets <hi>Joſeph</hi> in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62683:79"/>16, 17, 18. No ſooner was <hi>Iſrael</hi> poſſeſt of the good land that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with milk and honey, &amp;c. but they forſook the true worſhip of God, and fell to the worſhipping of Idols, for which at laſt the good land ſpewed them out as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration curſt and abhorred by God.</p>
            <p>Seventhly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> It layes them open to all carnal ſecurity; as you may ſee in the old world, their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity caſt them into a bed of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their ſecurity uſhered in a flood of ſin, and that flood of ſin uſhered in a flood of wrath, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.37, 38, 39.</p>
            <p>Eighthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> It layes them open to Idolatry, which is a God-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking, and a Land-deſtroying ſin, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. and <hi>chap</hi> 4.6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ah Sirs! who can ſeriouſly conſider of the dreadful ſins that the proſperity of the wicked layes them open to, and yet fret and vex at their proſperity?</p>
            <p>Again, As their proſperity layes them open to the greateſt ſins, ſo
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62683:79"/>their proſperity layes them open to the greateſt temptations, witneſſe their tempting of themſelves, and their own luſts, and witneſſe their temptings of others to the worſt of wickedneſſes and villanies, and witneſs their frequent tempting &amp; provoking of the great God to his own face, and witneſſe their daily, yea, their hourly tempting of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to tempt their own ſouls. Oh Sirs, as there is no condition that layes perſons open to ſuch great tranſgreſſions as proſperity doth, ſo there is no condition that layes perſons open to ſuch horrid temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as proſperity doth; and why then ſhould Gods holy ones envy wicked mens proſperity and worldly glory? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, their proſperity, and worldly felicity and glory, is all the portion, and all the heaven and happineſs that ever they are like to have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. <hi>From men of the world, which have their portion in this life.</hi> Certainly, men whoſe

That's a very heart-cutting and ſoul-killing word that you have in that <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, that they have their reward.</hi> The Scribes and Phariſees propoſed to themſelves the eyes of men, the praiſe of men, and the applauſe of men for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their almes, &amp;c. and Chriſt tells them, that they have their reward; not Gods reward,

            <p>
               <hi>Valerian</hi> the Roman Emperour fell, from being an Emperour to be a foot-ſtool to <hi>Sapor</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as often as he took horſe.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62683:82"/>wherein he was burnt by the <hi>Gothes.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Aurelianus</hi> the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour brought <hi>Tetricus</hi> his oppoſite, and the noble Queen <hi>Zenobia</hi> of <hi>Palmerina</hi> in triumph to <hi>Rome</hi> in golden chains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bajazet</hi> a proud Emperour of the Turks, being taken priſoner by <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Emperour, he bound him in chains of gold, and uſed him for a foot-ſtool when he took horſe; and when he eat meat, he made him gather crums under his table, and cat them for his food.</p>

               <hi>Caeſar</hi> having bathed his ſword in the blood of the Senate, and his own Countrey-men, is after a while miſerably murdered in the Senate by his own friends <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> to ſhew, that they are but the ſcourges and rods of the Almighty, which he will caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, as ſoon as he hath done with them.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62683:83"/>for the moſt part, became vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, fell to that poverty and miſery before he died, that he was forced to petition to be a Prebend in the Church of <hi>Spire</hi> to maintain him in his old age, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of that place denied him, whereupon he brake forth into that ſpeech of <hi>Job, Have pity upon me, O my friends, for the hand of the Lord hath touched me:</hi> He died of grief and want.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Procopius</hi> reports of King <hi>Guillimer,</hi> who was ſometimes a potent King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> that he was brought ſo low as to intreat his friend to ſende him a Sponge, a Loaf of Bread, and an Harp; a Sponge to dry up his tears, a Loaf of Bread to maintain his life, and an Harp to ſolace himſelf in his miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> was ſuch a cruel tyrant, that his people baniſhed him; after his baniſhment he went to <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he lived a baſe and contemptible life; at laſt he became a School-maſter;

By all theſe royal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances you ſee the truth of that which once a Royal Slave hinted to <hi>Seſoſtris;</hi> the Story runs thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> having taken many of his Neighbour-Kings priſoners, be made them to draw his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot by turnes; now it ſo happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that one of theſe royal ſlaves, as he was drawing in the Chariot, had his eye almoſt continually fixt on the wheels, which <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> obſerving, ask't him, why he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſeriouſly upon the wheels? he anſwered, that the falling of that ſpoke loweſt which was even now higheſt put him in mind of the inſtability of fortune; <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> duly weighing the parable, would never after be drawn by his Royal Slaves any more.</p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid, 'tis moſt evident that when wicked
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62683:84"/>men are higheſt, they are neereſt their fall; and that none fall ſo certainly and ſo ſuddenly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch dreadful calamities and miſeries as thoſe that have been moſt highly advanced in all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignities and glories; and why then ſhould any fret or vex at their outward proſperity, or worldly fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity?</p>
            <p>Again, God will bring them to an account for all thoſe talents of power, of honour, of riches,
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.14-31.</note> of truſt, of time, of intereſt that God hath given them in the world; and the more they have imployed the liberality and bounty of God againſt God, or his glory, or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or people, the ſhorter ſhall be their felicity, and the more end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhall be their miſery. The greateſt account and the greateſt damnation commonly attends the great ones of the world. I have read of <hi>Philip</hi> the third of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe life was free from groſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, profeſſing that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62683:85"/>loſe all his Kingdomes, than offend God willingly; yet being in the agony of death, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering more thorowly of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he was to give to God, fear ſtruck into him, and theſe words break from him, Oh would to God I had never reigned, Oh that thoſe years I have ſpent in my Kingdome, I had lived a private life in the wilderneſs; Oh that I had lived a ſolitary life with God; how much more confidently ſhould I have gone to the Throne of God? what doth all my glory profit me now, but that I have ſo much the more torment in my death, and the greater account to give up to God. I have read of a Souldier, who being to die for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a bunch of grapes contrary to his Generals command; as he was going along to execution he went eating of his grapes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one of his fellow-ſouldiers rebuked him, ſaying, what are you eating your grapes now you are going to execution? the poor
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62683:85"/>fellow replied, Prethee friend do not envy me my grapes, for I ſhall pay a dear price for them, I ſhall loſe my life for them; and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did: So I ſay, Oh you that have God for your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do not envy, do not fret and vex at the proſperity of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for what though they have more than heart can wiſh, what though they live in pleaſure, and wallow in all carnal and ſenſual delights, &amp;c. yet they have a ſad account to give up to God, and they ſhall pay dear at laſt for all their worldly enjoyments; for without ſound repentance on their ſides, and pardoning grace on Gods, they ſhall not only loſe their lives, but they ſhall alſo for ever loſe their immortal ſouls; and therefore never fret at their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.</p>
            <p>Oh Sirs, do not you remember that <hi>Lazarus</hi> did not fret nor fume becauſe <hi>Dives</hi> had robes for his rags, and delicates for his ſcraps? &amp;c. for he very well knew, that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62683:86"/>though he was <hi>ſine dome,</hi> yet not <hi>ſine domino;</hi> he had a guard of glorious Angels to tranſport his holy, precious heaven-born ſoul into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome; he knew that it was better to beg on earth, than to beg in hell: Oh Sirs, what is darkneſſe to light, earth to heaven, chaffe to wheat, tin to ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, droſſe to gold, or pibbles to pearls? no more are all earthly portions to that God who is the Saints portion: and therefore let not the Saints that have ſuch a matchleſſe portion envy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and felicity of wicked men. 'Tis the juſtice of envy to kill and torment the envious; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhun it as you would poiſon in your meat, or a ſerpent in the way. A man were better have a ſerpent tumbling up and down in his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, than to have envy a gnawing in his ſoul. Envy is as pernicious a wickedneſſe, as 'tis a fooliſh and a groundleſſe wickedneſſe; envy is a ſcourge to ſcourge the ſoul, 'tis a ſerpent to ſting the ſoul, 'tis a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62683:86"/>poiſon to ſwell the ſoul, 'tis a Sawe to ſawe the ſoul, 'tis a moth that corrupts the ſoul, and 'tis a canker that eats up the ſoul; and therefore fly from it, as you would fly from the moſt cruel and deſtroying ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. Oh Sirs, to be angry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is bountiful to others; to frown, becauſe God ſmiles upon others; to be bitter, becauſe God is ſweet in his dealings with others; and to ſigh, becauſe God multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies favours and bleſſings upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; what is this but to turn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good into our own hurt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers glory and mercy into our own puniſhment and torment? and if this be not to create a hell in our own hearts I am much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. I ſhall conclude this firſt Inference with the counſel of the Prophet in that 49. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>v. Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his houſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: For when he dieth he ſhall carry nothing away, his glory ſhall not deſcend after him.</hi> When the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the wicked are rotting in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62683:87"/>their graves, and their ſouls are roaring in hell, none of their worldly greatneſſe, pomp, ſtate, glory, gallantry, riches, rents or revenues ſhall deſcend after them to adminiſter one drop of comfort to them; and therefore never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy their outward proſperity or worldly glory, &amp;c. But</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If the Saints have ſuch an excellent, ſuch a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent, and ſuch a matchleſſe portion; Oh then let them be content with their preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let them ſit down ſatisfied and contented, though they have but a handful of meal in their Barrel,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 17.12.</note> and a little oil in a Cruſe. Oh Sirs, in having of God you have much, in having of God you have enough, in having of God you have all; and why then ſhould you not ſit down quiet with your preſent allowance? Certainly, if much will not ſatisfie you, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough will not ſatisfie you, if all will not ſatisfic you, nothing will
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62683:87"/>ſatisfie you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Let your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be without covetouſneſſe</hi> (or <hi>love of ſilver,</hi> as the Greek word ſignifies) <hi>and be content with ſuch things as you have,</hi> (or as the Greek hath it, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with preſent things) for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> There are five negatives in the Greek, <hi>I will not, not, not, not, not leave thee, nor forſake thee;</hi> fully to aſſure, and fully to ſatisfie the people of God that he will never forſake them, and that he will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly ſtick cloſe to them: What doth this unparallel'd ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>I will never, never, never, never, never,</hi> import but this, <hi>I will ever, ever, ever, yea and for ever and ever take care of thee, and look after thee, and be mindful of thee.</hi> Though they had changed their glory for contempt, their fine raiment for ſheep-skins and goat-skins,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.36, 37, 38.</note> their ſilver for braſſe, their plenty for ſcarcity, their fulneſſe for empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, their ſtately houſes for holes and caves, and dens of the earth,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62683:88"/>yet they are to be contented and ſatisfied with preſent things, upon this very ground, that God will alwayes cleave to them, and that he will never turn his back upon them.
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.34</note> The Hebrews had been ſtript and plundered of all their goods that were good for any thing, and yet they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, they muſt ſit down ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their hands upon their mouths, though all were gone. Though men cannot bring their means to their minds, yet they muſt bring their minds to their means, and then they will ſit down in ſilence, though they have but a rag on their backs, a penny in their purſe, and a cruſt in their Cupboords,
<note place="margin">Nature is content with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as not to ſtarve, not to thirſt, ſaith <hi>Galen.</hi>
               </note> &amp;c. O Sirs, a little will ſerve nature, leſſe will ſerve grace, though nothing will ſerve mens luſts; and why then ſhould not Chriſtians be contented with a little. Oh friends, you have but a ſhort journey to go, you have but a little way home, and a little will ſerve to bear your charges till
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62683:88"/>you come to heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be contented with a little; to have more than will ſerve to bring a man to his journeys end is but a burthen; one ſtaff is helpful to a man in his journey, but a bundle is hurtful; and this doubtleſſe <hi>Jacob</hi> well underſtood, when he made that propoſal in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20, 21. <hi>If God will give me bread to eat, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put on, then ſhall the Lord be my God. Jacob</hi> doth not ſay, if God will give me delicates and junkets to eat, he ſhall be my God, O no; but if he will give me but bread to eat, though it be never ſo courſe, and never ſo black, and never ſo dry, he ſhall be my God: he doth not ſay, If God will give me ſo many hundreds or ſo many thouſands a year, he ſhall be my God, O no; but if he will give me bread to eat, he ſhall be my God; nor he doth not ſay, If God will give me ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds in my purſe, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable habitation, and a thriving trade, he ſhall be my God, O no;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62683:89"/>but if he will give me bread to eat, he ſhall be my God; nor he doth not ſay, If God will give me coſtly apparel, or rich and royal raiment to put on, he ſhall be my God, O no; but if God will give me rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put on, though it be never ſo mean and poor, he ſhall be my God. If <hi>Jacob</hi> may but have a little bread to feed him, and a few cloaths to cover him, 'tis as much as he looks for. Look, as a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man in the fulneſſe of his ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is in ſtraits,
<note place="margin">Job. 20.22</note> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks; ſo a holy man in the fulneſſe of his ſtraits enjoys an all-ſufficiency in God, as you may ſee in <hi>Jacob.</hi> O Chriſtians, though you have but little, yet you have the higheſt and the nobleſt title that can be to that little that you do enjoy, for you hold all <hi>in capite,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſheweth in that large Charter of a Chriſtian, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. which the wicked do not. Now an hundred a year upon a good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is a better eſtate than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand a year upon a crack't, crazy
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62683:89"/>title; Saints have the beſt title under heaven for all they enjoy, be it little or be it much; but all the titles that ſinners have to their earthly enjoyments are but crazy titles, yea in compariſon of the Saints titles they are no titles.</p>
            <p>Again, That little that a Saint hath, he hath it from the ſpecial love and favour of God, he hath it from a reconciled God. Now a little from ſpecial love is better than a great deal from a general providence;
<note place="margin">Prov. 15.17</note> a penny from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled God is better than a pound from a bountiful God; a ſhilling from God as a father is a better eſtate than an hundred from God as a Creator. The kiſſe that a King gave to one in the ſtory, was a greater gift than the golden cup that he gave to another;
<note place="margin">Can. 1.2.</note> a little with the kiſſes of Gods mouth is better than all the gold of <hi>Ophir;</hi> a drop of mercy from ſpecial love is better than a Sea of mercy from common bounty.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62683:90"/>Look, as one draught of clear ſweet Spring-water is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſatisfying, and delightful to the pallat, than a Sea of brakiſh Salt-water: So one draught out of the fountain of ſpecial grace is more pleaſing, ſatisfying, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to a gracious ſoul, than a whole Sea of mercy from a ſpring of common grace: and therefore do not wonder when you ſee a Chriſtian ſit down contented with a little.</p>
            <p>Again, That little that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath ſhall be certainly bleſt and ſanctified to him:
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.3, 4, 5. 1 Tit. 15. Jer. 32.41, &amp;c.</note> Though thy mercies, O Chriſtian, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo few, and never ſo mean, yet they ſhall aſſuredly be bleſt unto thee; the Lord hath not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that he will bleſſe thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to thee, but he hath alſo ſworne by himſelf, that in bleſſing he will bleſſe thee;
<note place="margin">Gen. 22.16 17.</note> and how dar'ſt thou then, O Chriſtian, to think that the great and faithful God will be guilty of a lye, or that which is worſe, of perjury. Now
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62683:90"/>a little bleſt is better than a great deal curſt;
<note place="margin">Prov. 3.33. Mal. 2.2, 3.</note> a little bleſt is better than a world enjoyed; a pound bleſt is better than a thouſand curſt; a black cruſt bleſt is better than a feaſt curſt; the gleanings bleſt are better than the whole Harveſt curſt; a drop of mercy bleſt, is better than a Sea of mercy curſt; <hi>Lazarus</hi> crums bleſt, was better than <hi>Dives</hi> his delicates curſt; <hi>Jacobs</hi> little bleſt unto him,
<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> was better than <hi>Eſaus</hi> great eſtate that was curſt unto him; 'Tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes better to have ſcraps with a bleſſing, than to have Manna and Quails with a curſe;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.18-32.</note> a thin Table with a bleſſng is alwayes better than a full Table with a ſnare; a thread bare coat with a bleſſing is better than a purple Robe curſt; a Hole, a Cave, a Den, a Barne, a Chimney-corner with a bleſſing, is better than ſtately Palaces with a curſe; a woollen cap bleſt is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a golden Crown curſt; and it may be that Emperour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as much, that ſaid of his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62683:91"/>Crown when he look't on it with tears, If you knew the cares that are under this Crown you would never ſtoop to take it up. And therefore why ſhould not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian be contented with a little, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his little ſhall be bleſt unto him?
<note place="margin">Gen. 26.12</note> 
               <hi>Iſaac</hi> tils the ground, and ſowes his ſeed, and God bleſſes him with an hundred fold; and <hi>Cain</hi> tils the ground,
<note place="margin">Ch. 4.12.</note> and ſowes his ſeed, but the earth is curſed to him, and commanded not to yield to him his ſtrength. Oh therefore never let a Chriſtian murmur be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath but a little, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let him be ſtill a bleſſing of that God that hath bleſt his little, and that doth bleſſe his little, and that will bleſſe his little to him.</p>
            <p>Again, that little eſtate that a righteous man hath is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a more laſting,
<note place="margin">Prov. 15.16 &amp; ch. 16.8.</note> a more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding, a more permanent, and a more induring eſtate than the great and large eſtates of the wicked are, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16. <hi>A little that a

'Tis very obſervable, the Pſalmiſt doth not ſimply ſay, the eſtate, but the rich eſtate; the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es not of one, or a few, but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wicked, are not comparable to that little that a righteous man hath:

            <p>Oh Sirs, there are ſo many mothes, and ſo many dangers, and ſo many croſſes, and ſo many loſſes, and ſo many curſes that daily attends the great eſtates of wicked men, that they are very rarely long-liv'd ah! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this great City are there that have built their neſts on high, and that have thought that they had laid up riches for many years, and that have ſaid in their hearts, that their lands, and ſtocks, and trades,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62683:92"/>and houſes, and pompous eſtates ſhould abide for ever, who are now broken in pieces like a potters veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel? ah! how often doth the pride, the oppreſſion, the lying, the cheating, the over-reaching, the ſwearing, the curſing, the whoring, the covetouſneſſe, the drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the wantonneſſe of the wicked cut the throat of all their mercies? theſe are the wickedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that as a fire burnes up all their outward enjoyments, and that turnes their earthly paradiſe into a real hell; 'tis the wickedneſſe of the wicked that cauſeth their proſperity to wither, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes God to turn their plenty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſcarcity, their glory into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and their honour into ſhame; 'tis very obſervable that in the holy Scriptures the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtates of the wicked are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently compared to things of an abrupt exiſtence, to a ſhadow which ſoon paſſeth away,
<note place="margin">Job 14.2. Ch. 21.17, 18 Iſa 29.5.</note> to chaff, which a puff, a blaſt of wind eaſily diſperſeth and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth;

All the riches that the wicked gain, either by their trades, or by their friends, or by their great places, or by their high Offices, or by their ſubtil contrivances, or by their ſinful compliances; and all the honour they gain in the Court, or in the Camp, or in the School, is but light and inconſtant, 'tis but like the crackling of thorns under a pot; they are fading vanities, that commonly die before thoſe that enjoy them are laid in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Oh therefore let all Chriſtians be contented with their little, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their little ſhall outlaſt the large eſtates of wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men: A man that hath God for his portion can truly ſay that which no wicked man in the

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62683:96"/>all thoſe that have God for their portion. There is no happineſſe to that of having God for a mans portion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. <hi>Happy is that people that is in ſuch a caſe,</hi> (but give me that word again) <hi>yea, happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> He that hath not God for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can never be happy, and he that enjoys God for his portion can never be miſerable. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking of one, who paſſing by a ſtately houſe which had fair lands about it, and asking another whom be met, to whom that houſe and land belonged? he anſwered, to ſuch an one; Oh, ſayes he, that's a happy man indeed: No, ſayes the other, not ſo happy as you think, for it is no ſuch happineſſe to have that houſe and land; but he is happy indeed that hath the Lord for his God, for that is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that exceeds all things whatſoever; for (ſaith he) he that hath honours and riches may go to hell for all them, but he that hath God to be his God, is ſure to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62683:97"/>be everlaſtingly happy. According as a mans portion is, ſo is he; now if God be a mans portion, who is the ſpring, the fountain, the top of all excellency and glory, then certainly that man muſt needs be an excellent man that hath God for his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26.

Oh Sirs, if God be moſt excellent, if God be alone excellent, then they muſt needs be moſt excellent that have God for their portion. 'Tis very obſervable, that according to the excellency of God the

God delights to reflect his glory upon his Saints; for as there are none like to God, ſo there are none like to the people of God: Look, as God is a none-ſuch, ſo his

            <p>But ſuppoſe you were under many real wants, yet certainly this very Conſideration, that the Lord is your portion ſhould quiet your hearts, and beat up your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits bravely under them all. <hi>Jerome</hi> tells us of one <hi>Dydimus,</hi> a godly Preacher, who was blinde, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> a godly man coming to ſee him, asked him, whether he was not ſorely troubled and afflicted for want of his ſight: O yes, ſaid <hi>Dydimus,</hi> it is a very great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and grief to me; whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> chid him, ſaying, Hath God given you the excellency of an Angel, of an Apoſtle, and are you troubled for that which rats and mice, and bruit beaſts enjoy?

O Chriſtians, of all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the burthen of carking cares will ſit the heavieſt upon your ſpirits; there is no burthen that will bow you and break you like this; inordinate cares vex the heart, they divide the heart, they

<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.10</note> they pierce and wound the heart through and through with many ſorrows; inordinate cares will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crowd out Duties,

            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That they are a diſhonour and a reproach to the all ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, as if he were not able to ſupply all your wants, and to

            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Inordinate cares are a diſhonour and a reproach to the omniſciency of God;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 139. Pſal. 40.5. Job <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Inordinate cares are a diſhonour and a reproach to the authority of God;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 24.1. Pſal. 50.10.</note> as if the earth were not the Lords, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, and as if all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were not at his command and at his diſpoſe, whenas he is the great proprietary, and all is his by primitive right, and all the creatures are at his ſervice, and are ready at a word of command to ſerve where he pleaſeth, and when he pleaſeth, and as he pleaſeth, and whom he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Inordinate cares are a diſhonour and a reproach to the mercy, bounty, and liberality of God; they proclaim God to be a hard Maſter, and not to be of ſo free, ſo noble, and ſo generous a ſpirit, as Scripture and the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62683:116"/>of many thouſands ſpeaks him to be. I have read of a Duke of <hi>Millain,</hi> that marrying his daughter to a ſon of <hi>England,</hi> he made a Dinner of thirty Courſes, and at every Courſe he gave ſo many gifts to every gueſt at the Table, as there were Diſhes in the Courſe: Here was rich and royal entertainment, here was noble bounty indeed; but this bounty is not to be named in the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounty and liberality of God to his people is ſpoken of. Princes treaſures have been often exhauſted and drawn dry,
<note place="margin">Mercy &amp; bounty is as eſſential to God, as light is to the Sun, or as heat is to the fire.</note> but the treaſures of Gods bounty and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality were never, nor never ſhall be exhauſted or drawn dry. O Sirs, you are as well able to tell the Stars of heaven, and to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſands of the Sea, as you are able to number up the mercies and favours of God that attends his people in one day, yea, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends them in one hour of the day, or in one minute of an hour, ſuch is his liberality and bounty
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62683:117"/>towards them. God is alwayes beſt, when he is moſt in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his bounty and liberality towards his people; his favours and mercies ſeldome come ſingle; there is a Series, a concatenation of them, and every former draws on a future; yea, ſuch is the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and liberality of God, that he never takes away one mercy, but he hath another ready to lay in the room of it; as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> began to ſhine before <hi>Moſes</hi> his candle was put out; and before <hi>Joſhuah</hi> went to bed, <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Jews have a ſaying, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth there die any illuſtrious man, but there is another born as bright on the ſame day. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Inordinate cares are a reproach and a diſhonour to the fidelity of God, as if he were not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62683:117"/>the faithful witneſſe,
<note place="margin">Rev. 1.5. Ch. 3.14. Iſa. 49.7. 1 Cor. 1.9. Ch. 10.13. 2 Theſ. 3.3. Heb. 10.23. Rev. 19.11. Heb. 6.13-19.</note> the faithful God, that hath bound himſelf by promiſe, by covenant, and by oath to take care of his people, and to provide for his people, and to look after the welfare of his people. God is that Ocean and Fountain from whence all that faithfulneſſe that is in Angels and men do iſſue and flow, and his faithfulneſſe is the rule and meaſure of all that faithfulneſſe that is in all created beings, and his faithfulneſſe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable and perfect: though the Angels fell from their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and <hi>Adam</hi> fell from his yet it is impoſſible that ever God ſhould fall from his. Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe is a foundation-faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is that foundation, upon which all our faith, hope, prayers, praiſes, and obedience ſtands; and therefore whoever is unfaithful, God will be ſure to ſhew himſelf a faithful God, in making good all that he hath ſpoken concerning them that fear him. I had rather, ſaid <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that men ſhould ſay,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62683:118"/>there was never any ſuch perſon in the world as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> rather than ſay, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> is unfaithful; men were better ſay, that there is no God, than to ſay that God is an unfaithful God; and yet this is the conſtant language of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cares. O Sirs, Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe inclines him to make good promiſes,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1 4.</note> precious promiſes, and his faithfulneſſe engages him to make thoſe promiſes good; if the word be once gone out of his mouth,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.18.</note> heaven and earth ſhall ſooner paſſe away than one jot of that Word ſhall fail. Men ſay and unſay what they have ſaid, they often eat their words as ſoon as they have ſpoke them, but ſo will not God: This faithfulneſſe of God <hi>Joſhna</hi> ſtoutly aſſerts to the heighth; he throws down the Gantler,
<note place="margin">Joſh. 23.14, 15.</note> and doth as it were chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſhew but that one thing that God had failed them in of all the good things that he had promiſed. If God in very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe afflicts his people to make
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62683:118"/>good his threatnings,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 119.75.</note> O how much more in faithfulneſſe will he preſerve and provide for his people, to make good his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? God hath never broke his word, nor crack't his credit by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, or by compounding for one penny leſs in the pound, than what he hath promiſed to make good; God ſtands upon nothing more than his faithfulneſſe, and glories in nothing more than his faithfulneſſe; and yet all inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cares leaves a blot upon his faithfulneſſe. But</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Inordinate cares are a reproach to the pity and compaſſion of God;
<note place="margin">Matth. 6.32.</note> they ſpeak out God to be a God of no pity, of no bowels, of no tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereas God is all pities, all bowels, all compaſſions, all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. <hi>Like as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pitieth his children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him:</hi> there is an Ocean of love and pity in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers heart to his children,
<note place="margin">Gen. 33.13, 14.</note> and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62683:119"/>there is much more in Gods to his: Hence he is called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by way of eminency; and indeed originally and properly there is no Father to him, there is no Father like him, there is no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſides him;
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.15 God is <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum, tam pius nom<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o, tam pater nemo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard.</hi>
               </note> and he is called the Father of all mercies, becauſe all the mercies, all the pities, all the bowels, all the compaſſions that are in all the Fathers on earth are but a drop of his Ocean, a ſpark of his flame, a mite out of his Treaſury. That Father that ſees his childe in want, and pities him not, and pitying, if able, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves him not, forfeits the very name of father, and may better write himſelf monſter than man. I have read of a young man, who being at Sea in a mighty Storm, was very merry, when all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were at their wits end for fear, &amp;c. and when he was asked the reaſon of his mirth, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the Pilot of the Ship was his father, and he knew that ſuch was his fathers pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62683:119"/>that he would have a care of him: O Sirs, whatever ſtorms the people of God may be in, yet ſuch is his pity and compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, that he will be ſure to have a care of them. The Lord is all that to his people, and will be all that to his people, yea, and infinitely more than that which <hi>Iſis Mammoſa</hi> was to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, a God full of dugs; and whil'ſt he hath a breaſt there is no reaſon why his children ſhould fear the want of milk. That golden promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. were there no more, hath enough in it to ſteel and arm the ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all inordinate cares. The Greek hath five Negatives,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> If God be the Saints portion, and ſuch a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as I have at large diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him to be; then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God is no injurious portion, no miſchievous portion, no hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful portion, no prejudicial portion; ſurely there can be no danger, no hazard, no hurt in having God for a mans portion. O but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times earthly portions do a great deal of hurt, a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, they ruine mens bodies, they
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62683:122"/>blaſt and blot mens names, and they lay men open to ſuch ſins, and ſnares, and temptations, that for ever undoes their immortal ſouls. O what a Trappan are worldly portions to moſt men? yea, what fuel are they to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? and how often do they lay perſons open to deſtruction? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>There is a ſore evil which I have ſeen under the Sun, namely, riches kept for the owners therefore to their hurt.</hi> Though riches in themſelves are Gods bleſſings, yet through the corruptions that are in mens hearts they prove weapons of wickedneſs, and engines to evil: <hi>There is a ſore evil,</hi> the Septuagint reads it, <hi>infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas peſſima,</hi> a ſore diſeaſe; <hi>Pagnin</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> reads it <hi>mala in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitas,</hi> an evil diſeaſe; others read it, <hi>languor peſſimus,</hi> a ſore weakneſs; the Hebrew word <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> ſignifies ſuch a ſore evil as ſticks cloſe, and is not eaſily remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; they are kept a thouſand thouſand wayes for their hurt. <hi>Latimer</hi> in a Sermon before King
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62683:123"/>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, tells a ſtory of a rich man, that when he lay upon his ſick bed, ſome told him that came to viſit him, that by all they were able to diſcern he was a dead man, he was no man for this world; as ſoon as ever he heard theſe words (ſaith <hi>Latimer</hi>) what muſt I die? ſaid the ſick man; ſend for a Phyſician; wounds, ſides, heart, muſt I die, and leave theſe riches behind me? wounds, ſides, heart, muſt I die, and leave theſe things behind me; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe could be got from him but wounds, heart, ſides, muſt I die, and leave theſe riches behind me? Do you think, Sirs, that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were not kept for this mans hurt? without a peradventure in this mans heart was write the God of this preſent world.</p>
            <p>And the ſame Father <hi>Latimer</hi> elſewhere ſaith, that if he had an enemy to whom it was lawful to wiſh evil, he would chiefly wiſh him great ſtore of riches, for then he ſhould never enjoy any quiet.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62683:123"/>As I have read of one <hi>Pheraulas,</hi> a poor man, on whom King <hi>Cyrus</hi> beſtowed ſo much that he knew not what to do with his riches; being wearied out with care in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of them, he deſired to live quietly, though poor, as he had done before, than to poſſeſs all thoſe riches with diſcontent; therefore he gave away all his wealth, deſiring onely to enjoy ſo much as might relieve his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and give him a quiet poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid, when ſhe was dying, that if they ſhould open her when ſhe was dead, they ſhould finde <hi>Calice</hi> lying at the bottome of her heart, implying, that the loſs of it broke her heart.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtorian obſerves, that the riches of <hi>Cyprus</hi> invited the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to hazard many dangerous Fights for the conquering of it.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Indians</hi> had taken ſome of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who made

            <p>Firſt,

               <note place="margin">Not only the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ten perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, but alſo all other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories do very ſtrongly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this.</note> Riches incourage and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage perſons to make the ſtrongeſt and the ſtouteſt oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt any thing that is good; rich perſons uſually are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt oppoſers both of religion and religious perſons, <hi>James</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>But ye have deſpiſed the poor; do not rich men oppreſſe you, and draw you before the judgment-ſeats?

            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Earthly portions do eſtrange the heart from God, as you ſee in the prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. and in thoſe wealthy Monſters that <hi>ſay unto God, Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways: What is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have, if we pray unto him? Job</hi> 21.13, 14, 15. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As earthly portions do eſtrange the ſoul from God; ſo they do often ſwell the ſoul, and puff up the ſoul. <hi>Salvian</hi> counts pride the rich mans inheritance;

All thoſe things are paſſed away like as a ſhadow, and as a poſt that paſſeth by,</hi> Wiſd. 5.8, 9. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Earthly riches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly caſt men into a deep ſleep of ſecurity; thus they ſerved <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6, 7. and thus they ſerved the fool in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.16-22.

But</p>
            <pb n="214" facs="tcp:62683:126"/>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Earthly riches do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently divert the ſouls of men from imbracing and cloſing with the golden ſeaſons and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of grace.
<note place="margin">Matth. 13.22.</note> Riches are the thorns that choak the Word, and that make men barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful under the Word. Rich <hi>Felix</hi> had no leiſure to hear poor <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 24.24-ult.</note> though the hearing of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon might have ſaved his ſoul, and made him happy in both worlds; and the rich fool in the Goſpel was ſo taken up in pulling down his Barnes,

But ah how rare is it to ſee rich men covet after hearing times, and praying times, and reading times, and meditating times, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, and repenting times, and reforming times: Rich men will have time for every thing, but to honour God, exalt Chriſt, obey the Spirit, love the Saints, attend Ordinances, and ſave their own immortal ſouls. O the time, the thoughts, the ſtrength, the ſpirits that rich men ſpend and conſume upon their riches, whil'ſt their precious ſouls lie a bleeding to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62683:127"/>death, and an eternity of miſery is poſting upon them. But</p>
            <p>Sixthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Earthly riches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly load the ſoul with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of cares, fears, griefs, and vexations, which do mightily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the ſoul, diſtract the ſoul, yea, often rack, torture, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſoul.

But</p>
            <p>Seventhly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Earthly riches ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times are fuel for the greateſt and the groſſeſt ſins; as pride,

            <p>Eighthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Earthly riches are many times reſerved as witneſſes againſt the rich in the great day of their account, <hi>James</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for the miſeries that ſhall come upon you: Your riches are corrupted, and your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments moth-eaten; your gold and ſilver is cankered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſſe against you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire; ye have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped treaſure together for the laſt dayes:</hi> The ruſt of the rich mans canker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gold and his moth-eaten appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel ſhall be brought in as dreadful

            <p>O but now God is a portion that will never hurt a man, that will never harm a man, that will never in the leaſt prejudice a man. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.22, 23.</note> there is not one to be found that will give in his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt this ſweet and bleſſed Truth that I have aſſerted; and among all the Saints on earth you ſhall not finde one, but will with both hands readily ſubſcribe to this glorious Maxime, <hi>viz.

And by daily experience we finde that of all men wealthy men are moſt unwilling to die.

            <p>Twelfthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> If God be the Saints portion, O then let the Saints ſtill
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62683:130"/>think of God, and look upon God under this notion; A man that hath God for his portion ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have very high, noble, ſweet and precious thoughts of God: It becomes not thoſe that have God for their portion to be alwayes looking upon God as an angry God, or as a diſpleaſed Father, or as an incenſed Judge, or as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged enemy, or as a bitter friend.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 77. &amp; Pſa 88. Job 3.

            <p>I have both heard and read of a rare ſtory of Mrs. <hi>Honywood</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous profeſſor of the Goſpel, and one that for many years together lay under the burthen of a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſpirit, and was much troubled in mind for want of aſſurance that God was her portion, and that ſhe ſhould be ſaved from wrath to come: at length there came a godly Miniſter to her, who indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſettle her faith and hope in Chriſt; and preſſing many Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-promiſes upon her, ſhe took it with a kinde of indignation and anger that he ſhould offer to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any promiſes to her, to whom (as ſhe thought) they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; and having a <hi>Venice</hi>-glaſſe in her hand, ſhe held it up, and ſaid, Speak no more to me of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for I ſhall as ſurely be damn'd, as this poor brittle glaſſe ſhall be broke againſt the wall,

            <p>Firſt,

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62683:138"/>will come to be fixed, ſetled, and eſtabliſhed: A mans ſoul never comes to be fixed and ſetled, by knowing in the general that God is the Saints portion, but by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal evidence and certainty of knowledge that he is his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar portions whil'ſt a mans parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular propriety is unſetled, all is unſetled in his ſoul; but when a mans particular propriety is ſetled, when he can ſay,

            <pb n="239" facs="tcp:62683:138"/>
            <p>Secondly, A clear,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> perſonal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that God is a mans portion will rid his ſoul of all ſinful doubts. O Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">Luke 24.14 15.</note> now your hearts are as full of doubts, as hell is full of darkneſſe; one day you doubt whether your graces are true, and another day you doubt whether your comforts are true; now you doubt of your Saintſhip, and anon of your Sonſhip, and then of your Heirſhip; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you doubt of your commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, ſometimes you doubt of your acquaintance with God, and ſometimes you doubt of your acceptance with God; one hour you doubt of the favour of God, and the next hour you doubt of your acceſſe to God: And as it is thus with you, ſo it will be thus with you, till you come to have ſome clear ſatisfaction in your own ſpirits, that God is your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O Chriſtians, had you but once a perſonal evidence in your own boſomes that God is your portion, all thoſe doubts that are
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62683:139"/>bred and fed by ignorance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and that rob the ſoul of all joy comfort, and content, and that render men Babes in Chriſtianity, and that caſt reproach upon God, Chriſt, and the Promiſes, &amp;c. and that do moſt gratifie and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage Satan to tempt and try your ſouls, would vaniſh and diſperſe as the Clouds do before the Sun when it ſhines in its brightneſſe: till a Chriſtians eyes be opened to ſee God to be his portion, his heart will be full of doubts and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities.
<note place="margin">John 20.13, 14, 15, 16.</note> Though <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was very neer to Chriſt, yet ſhe ſtands ſighing, mourning, and complaining, <hi>That they had ſtollen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her Lord.</hi> A Chriſtian may have God for his portion, yet till he comes to ſee God to be his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he will ſpend his dayes in ſighing, mourning, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; O Chriſtians, till you come to ſee God to be your portion, your doubts will lie down with you, and riſe with you; they will talk with you, and walk with you,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62683:139"/>till they make your lives a very hell. 'Twas an excellent expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Luther,</hi> The whole Scripture (ſaith he) doth principally aim at this thing, That we ſhould not doubt, but that we ſhould hope, truſt, and believe that God is a merciful, bountiful, and gracious God to his people; And what will bring a mans heart over to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this bleſſed aime of the Scripture? certainly nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an aſſurance, that God is his portion It was a noble reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bleſſed <hi>Bradford,</hi> who in one of his Epiſtles, ſaith thus, <hi>O Lord ſometimes methinks I feel it ſo with me, as if there were no difference between my heart and the hearts of the wicked; my mind is as blind as theirs, and my will as ſtout, ſtubborn, and rebellious as theirs, and my affections as much diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as theirs, and my conſcience as much benummed and ſtupified as theirs, and my heart as hard and flintie as theirs, &amp;c. ſhall I therefore conclude, that thou art not my father? nay, I will rather reaſon otherwiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I do
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62683:140"/>believe thou art my Father, I will come unto thee, that thou mayeſt enlighten this blind mind of mine, and bend and bow this ſtout and ſtubborn will of mine, and that thou mayeſt put order into theſe diſordered affections of mine, and that thou mayeſt put life and quickneſſe into this ſtupified and benummed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of mine, and that thou mayeſt put ſoftneſſe and tenderneſſe into this hard and ſlitie heart of mine:</hi> And thus he nobly reaſoned himſelf, and believed himſelf out of all his fears and doubts. There is no ſuch way for a man to be rid of all his doubts, as to live in the ſight and faith of this truth, that God is his portion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of one; who would not be reſolved of his doubts, becauſe he would not loſe the pleaſure in ſeeking for reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like to him that would not have his Phyſician to quench the thirſt he felt in his Ague, becauſe he would not loſe the pleaſure of drinking; and like thoſe that would not be freed from their ſins,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62683:140"/>becauſe they would not loſe the pleaſure of ſinning: But I hope better things of all thoſe that have God for their portion, than to find them in love with their doubts, or to be unwilling to be rid of their doubts. Next to a mans going to hell, it is one of the greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in the world for a man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to live in doubts about his going to heaven; Next to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is one of the greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that can attend a Chriſtian to be alwayes exerciſed and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with doubts about his ſalvation; Next to being damn'd, 'tis the hell of hells to live in continual fears of damnation: Now the onely way to prevent all this, is to know that God is your portion. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A clear,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> perſonal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that God is a mans portion, will exceedingly ſweeten all the croſſes, loſſes, and changes that ſhall attend him in this world. <hi>Habakkuk</hi> knew that God was the God of his ſalvation, and that he

And ſo the Apoſtles knew that they had an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens; and this carried them bravely thorow honour and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, thorow evil report and good report, and thorow all weakneſſes, ſickneſſes, diſtreſſes, wants, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and death; and this made their heavy afflictions light,

<note place="margin">Acts 5. &amp; Ch. 16.</note> and hearts of others. When a man hath a clear perſonal evidence that God is his portion, then no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward changes will make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable change in him.

<note place="margin">Mal. 4.1. Heb. 10.38.</note> theſe change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſhall be as ſtubble before it: God abhors none as he doth thoſe who run from him to ſerve other lords, and who gad about to change their way, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.36, 37. <hi>Why gaddest thou about ſo much to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A clear perſonal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that God is a mans por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will exceedingly raiſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the comfort and joy of a mans heart; 'tis not meerly my having of God for my portion, but 'tis my ſeeing, 'tis my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'tis my fruition of God as my portion, that is the true ſpring of all delight, comfort, and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62683:143"/>ſolation to him,

When a mans intereſt in God is clear, then his heaven of joy begins: a man that hath God for his portion, and knows it, cannot but live in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of joy, and walk in a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of joy, and work in a paradiſe of joy, and eat in a paradiſe of joy, and recreate himſelf in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of joy, and reſt in a paradiſe of joy; he cannot but have an heaven of joy within him, and an heaven of joy about him, and an heaven of joy over him; all his looks will ſpeak out joy within, and all his words will ſpeak out joy within, and all his works will ſpeak out joy within, and all his wayes will ſpeak out joy within.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62683:143"/>I remember a notable ſaying of one,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</note> How ſweet was it to me of a ſudden to be without theſe ſweet vanities! and theſe things which I was afraid to loſe, with joy I let go, for thou who art the true and only ſweetneſs, didſt caſt out thoſe from me, and inſtead of them didſt enter in thy ſelf, who art more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful than all pleaſure, and more clear than all light. When a mans intereſt in God is clear,
<note place="margin">Joh. 16.24</note> his joy will be full; when a man is happy, and knows it, he cannot but rejoyce; when a man hath God for his portion, and knows it, all the world cannot hinder the ſtrong conſolations of God from riſing high in his ſoul: Why have the Saints in heaven more joy and delight than the Saints on earth, but becauſe they have a clearer and a fuller knowledge of their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and propriety in God than the others have? The knowledge of a mans propriety in God is the comfort of comforts: propriety makes every comfort a pleaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62683:144"/>comfort, a delightful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. When a man walks in a fair Meadow, and can write <hi>Mine</hi> upon it, and into a pleaſant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and can write <hi>Mine</hi> upon it, and into a fruitful Corn-field, and can write <hi>Mine</hi> upon it, and into a ſtately Habitation, and can write <hi>Mine</hi> upon it, and into a rich Myne, and can write <hi>Mine</hi> upon it, O how doth it pleaſe him? how doth it delight him? how doth it joy and rejoyce him? Of all words this word <hi>Meum</hi> is the ſweeteſt and the comfortableſt: Ah, when a man can look upon God, and write <hi>Meum;</hi> when he can look upon God, and ſay, This God is my God for ever and ever; when he can look upon God, and ſay, this God is my portion; when he can look upon God, and ſay with <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62683:144"/>for his portion, in having of whom he hath all things, in having of whom he can want nothing. The ſerious thoughts of our propriety in God will add much ſweet to all our ſweets, yea, it will make every bitter ſweet; when a man ſeriouſly thinks it is my God that cheares me with his preſence, it is my God that ſupports me with his power, it is my God that guides me by his counſel, it is my God that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies me with his goodneſſe, and it is my God that bleſſes all my bleſſings to me; it is my God that afflicts me in love, it is my God that hath broken me in my eſtate, and in my credit, it is my God that hath ſorely viſited ſuch a child, it is my God that hath paſt a ſentence of death upon ſuch a friend, it is my God that hath thus ſtraitned me in my liberty, and it is my God that hath thus caſt me down at my enemies feet, &amp;c. how doth theſe thoughts cheer up the ſpirit of a man, and make every bitter ſweet, and every burthen light unto him.</p>

            <p>A beautiful face is at all times pleaſing to the eye, but then eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when there is joy manifeſted in the countenance; joy in the face puts a new beauty upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and makes that which before was beautiful to be exceeding beautiful, it puts a luſtre upon beauty; and ſo doth holy joy put a divine beauty and luſtre upon all the wayes of God, and upon all the people of God; and therefore it highly concerns all Chriſtians, as they would have an heavenly beauty, luſtre, and glory upon them, to rejoyce, and that they may rejoyce, it doth as highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them to know their intereſt and propriety in God.

A clear ſight of your propriety in God is the very life of promiſes, the life of Ordinances, the life of Providences, the life of experiences, and the life of your gracious evidences; it is a pearl of price, it is your Paradiſe, it is Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in a wilderneſſe, it is water out of a Rock, it is a cloud by day,

But</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, A clear perſonal evidence that God is a mans portion will exceedingly ſweeten the thoughts of death,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and all the approaches of death, and all the warnings and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of death unto him; it will make a man look upon his laſt day as his beſt day,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.1. Job 18.14.</note> it will make a man look upon the King of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours as the King of deſires, it will make a man laugh at the ſhaking of the ſpear at the ſounding of the trumpet, at the confuſed noiſe of the battel, at

A man that ſees his propriety in God, knowes that death ſhall be the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of all his ſins, ſorrows, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, temptations, deſertions, oppoſitions, vexations, oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and perſecutions, and he knows that death ſhall be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of his hopes, joyes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, comforts, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

Now this laſt Inference leads me by the hand to an uſe of trial and examination. O Sirs, if God be the Saints portion, the believers portion, how highly doth it concern every one that looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, as a Saint, or as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, to ſearch, try, and examine whether God be his portion, or no?</p>

Now this woman, the Church, is ſaid to have the Moon under her feet: by the Moon we are to underſtand all tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and tranſitory things; now the Church treads upon all theſe things as traſh and trumpery that were much below her, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by her. Look, as the great men of the world do commonly look upon all portions that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their own with an eye of ſcorn, diſdain, and contempt,
<note place="margin">Eſth. 5.9—ult. Pſa. 73.4-13.</note> as <hi>Haman</hi> did, and as thoſe bold da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſinners did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. So do thoſe that have God for their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion look upon all things below their God with an eye of ſcorn and diſdain. I have read of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that after his reſurrection from he dead he was never ſeen to laugh, his thoughts, his heart, his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo fixt upon God, and ſo taken up with God, with his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he was as a dead man
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:62683:174"/>to all the gay and gallant things of the world, he ſaw nothing in them worthy of a ſmile.</p>
            <p>And ſo when once <hi>Galiacius</hi> that famous Italian Marqueſſe came to underſtand that God was his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the face of the higheſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers imaginable, of honour, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, profit, and preferment, he cried out, Curſed be he that prefers all the glory of the world to one dayes communion with God.</p>
            <p>The old Grecians who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fed on Acorns before,
<note place="margin">Euſtath. in Homer.</note> when bread came in among them they made no reckoning of their maſt, but reſerved it only for their Swine. And the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> deſpiſed their iron and leathern money,
<note place="margin">Seneca de Benefic.</note> when gold and ſilver came in uſe among them; ſo when a man comes once to experience God to be his portion, ah, at what a low rate will he value the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling honours,
<note place="margin">John 4.14.</note> the deceitful riches, and the vaniſhing pleaſures of this beggarly world. Chriſtians are compared to Eagles;
<note place="margin">Matth. 24.28.</note> now the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62683:174"/>Eagle is a Kingly, a Princely bird, 'tis a bird of a ſharp piercing ſight, and of a ſwift and lofty flight, it flies high, and ſets light by things below (except it be when neceſſity compells her) and ſo 'tis with thoſe that have God for their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they fly high, and they live high in God, and therefore they cannot but ſet light by the toyes and trifles of the world. But</p>
            <p>Eighthly, If God be thy porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> then thy God is moſt precious to thee, then thou ſetteſt the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt price and value imaginable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy God; every man ſets the higheſt price upon his portion; though a man may ſet a good price upon his delightful gardens, his pleaſant walks, his delicate fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds, his fruitful trees, his ſweet flowers, &amp;c. yet 'tis no price to that which he ſets upon his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Well, ſayes a man, though here be an hundred things to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my eye, and to pleaſe my fancy, and to ſatiate my appetite,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:62683:175"/>yet I infinitely value my portion above them all: And who but a fool in <hi>Folio</hi> will value a thouſand a year above a few accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are onely for pleaſure and delight: So though a Chriſtian may ſet a conſiderable value upon all his outward comforts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 23.24, 25. Pſa. 4.6, 7.</note> yet 'tis no value to that he ſets upon his God, upon his portion; this and that is precious to me, ſaith a Chriſtian, but my God is infinitely more precious than all. A Chriſtian ſets up God above his goods; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. and above his luſts; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his relations; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.1-7. yea, and above his very life; <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. <hi>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death:</hi> Pſa. 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindneſſe is better than life:</hi> the Hebrew is <hi>Chaiim, lives;</hi> put many lives together, yet there is more excellency and glory in the leaſt beam, in the leaſt diſcovery of divine love, than there is in
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:62683:175"/>them all: A man may be weary of life, but never of divine love; Hiſtories tell us of many that have been weary of their lives, but no Hiſtories can furniſh us with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any one that was ever weary of divine love. Look, as the people prized <hi>David</hi> above themſelves, ſaying,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.3.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art worth ten thouſand of us;</hi> ſo they that have indeed God for their portion, O how do they prize God above themſelves, and above every thing below themſelves! and doubtleſſe they that in a courſe do not lift up God above all, they have no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God at all. Whatever a man eyes as his greateſt intereſt, that he ſets up above all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other things in the world. Now if a man eyes God as his greateſt intereſt, he cannot but ſet God atop of all. I have not faith enough to believe,
<note place="margin">Luk. 14.26</note> that ever ſuch did truly love God, who love any thing more than God, or who ſet up any thing above God. Look, as <hi>Darius</hi> ſet up <hi>Daniel</hi> over all, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:62683:176"/>as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſet up <hi>Joſeph</hi> above all, ſo a man that hath God for his portion, he ſets up God over all, and he ſets up God above all. One ſet ſo high a price upon Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Auſtin</note> that he hath long ſince told us, that he would willingly goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hell to Chriſt;
<note place="margin">Bernard</note> and, ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, I had rather be in my chimny-corner with Chriſt, than in heaven without him: When one of the Martyrs was offered ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and honours if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, he made this excellent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Do but offer me ſomewhat that is better than my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and you ſhall ſee what I will ſay to you.
<note place="margin">Johannes Mollius.</note> And I have read of another that ſet ſo high a price upon the Lord Jeſus, that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did but mention the name of Jeſus, his eyes dropt tears; were every Star in the Firmament a Sun, yet a man that hath God for his portion would prize him above them all.</p>
            <p>Do you ask me,
<note place="margin">Plutarch in Photion.</note> where be my Jewels? my Jewels are my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:62683:176"/>ſaid <hi>Phocions</hi> wiſe; do you ask me, where be my ornaments? my ornaments are my two ſonnes brought up in vertue and learning, ſaid the mother of the <hi>Graccht:</hi> do you ask me, where be my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? my treaſures are my friends, ſaid <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the father of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine;</hi> So if you ask a Chriſtian that hath God for his portion, where his jewels, his ornaments, his treaſures, his comforts, and the delights of his ſoul are, he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you, that they are all in God, he will tell you that God is his portion, and that God is his great all, and that he enjoys all in God, and God in all; and therefore he cannot but prize God above all. But to prevent miſtakes in this weighty caſe, let me give you a few brief hints; As</p>
            <p>Firſt, If God be truly precious to thee, then all of God is precious to thee, his Name is precious to thee, his Honour is precious to thee, his Ordinances are precious to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:62683:177"/>thee, his Sabbaths are precious to thee, his promiſes are precious to thee, his precepts are precious to thee, his threatnings are precious to thee, his rebukes are precious to thee, his people are precious to thee, and all his concernments are precious to thee. Look, as every ſparkling ſtone that is ſet round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a rich Diamond is precious in the eyes of the Jeweller, ſo is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſparkling excellency in God precious in his eyes that ſets an high value upon God.
<note place="margin">It was an harlot that would have the child divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. 1 Kings 3.25, 26.</note> Look, as all of the new-born babe is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the eyes of the tender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as head, face, hands, arms, body, feet, &amp;c. ſo all of God is very precious in his eyes that hath any tender regard of God; and look, as all of an husband is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the eyes of a loving wife, <hi>viz.</hi> his perſon, name, credit, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, eſtate, liberty, life, &amp;c. ſo all of God is very precious in his eyes that loves God with a real love, with a ſuperlative love. But</p>
            <pb n="317" facs="tcp:62683:177"/>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If God be moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to thee, then all the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that are done to God, his truth, his worſhip, his wayes, his ordinances, his inſtitutions, his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, his people, are moſt grievous and burthenſome to thee.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.9. Pſ. 119.158.</note> 
               <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. I beheld the tranſgreſſours, and was grieved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they kept not thy word;</hi> the word that is here tranſlated <hi>grieved</hi> is from <hi>Katat,</hi> that ſignifies to loath, abhor, and contend; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the tranſgreſſours, and I loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed them; I beheld the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours, and I abhorred them; I beheld the tranſgreſſours, and I contended with them; but not ſo much becauſe they were mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as becauſe they were thine. Tis juſt between God and all thoſe that have a precious eſteem of him, as 'tis between two Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings that are tuned one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; no ſooner one is ſtruck, but the other trembles.
<note place="margin">Jer. 9.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> A Saint can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee God ſtruck, but his heart
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:62683:178"/>will tremble. A Father lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his death-bed, called three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to him, which he kept, and told them that one onely of them was his natural ſon,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Tongue.</note> and that the other two were onely brought up by him, therefore unto him onely he gave all his goods; but which of thoſe three was his own ſon, he would not in any wiſe declare: when he was dead, every one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his birth-right, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being brought to trial, the Judge for the making (if poſſible) a true diſcovery, took this courſe; He cauſed the dead Corps of the Father to be ſet up againſt a tree, and commanded the three ſons to take bows and arrowes, to ſhoot at their. Father, to ſee who could come neereſt to his heart; the firſt and ſecond did ſhoot and hit him, but the third was very much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and diſpleaſed with them both, and through the natural affection of a child to a father, threw away his bow and arrows, and would not ſhoot at all; this
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:62683:178"/>being done, the Judge gave this ſentence, <hi>viz.</hi> That the two firſt that ſhot (at their ſuppoſed fathers heart) were no ſons, but that the third ſon that would not ſhoot at all, and that was very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with thoſe that did ſhoot was the true ſon, and that he ſhould have the goods. O Sirs, every bitter word is an arrow ſhot at the heart of God, and every bloody oath is an arrow ſhot at the heart of God, and every heavy curſe is an arrow ſhot at the beart of God, and every ſuperſtitious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is an arrow ſhot at the heart of God, and every ſnare that is laid for the righteous is an arrow ſhot at the heart of God, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yoke that is laid upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God is an arrow ſhot at the heart of God, and every affront that by debauched perſons is given to God, is an arrow ſhot at the heart of God, &amp;c. And what true bred ſons, what ingenious ſons can ſee ſuch arrows every hour in the day ſhot at the heart of God
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:62683:179"/>(and hear of ſuch arrows that are ſhot a thouſand, thouſand times in a day at the heart of God) and not grieve and mourn, and not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, troubled, diſpleaſed, and aſtoniſhed, to ſee men and to hear of men that were once made in the Image of God to be turned into ſuch incarnate Devils, as thus to deal with God, yea, with ſuch a God as can ſpeak them into hell at his pleaſure. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If God be moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to you, then you will part with any thing for God,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.7, 8, Mat. 13.46.</note> then you will let go any thing that you may hold your God, and enjoy your God,
<note place="margin">Gen. 22. Chap. 43.</note> then your <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall be made a ſacrifice, if God will have it ſo; and your <hi>Benjamin</hi> ſhall be ſent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> if God will have it ſo;
<note place="margin">Jonah 1.</note> then your <hi>Jonah</hi> ſhall be caſt over-board, if God will have it ſo, then out goes the right eye, and off goes the right hand upon a divine command; then you will never cry out, O this mercy is too
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:62683:179"/>neer to me to part with for God, and that comfort is too dear to me to part with for God, &amp;c. O no, but then you will ſay, as the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 14.21.</note> 
               <hi>Give me the perſons, and take the goods to thy ſelf:</hi> So you will ſay, Give us God, O give us God, and let who will take the goods, let who will take the honours, and the profits, and the pleaſures of the world; 'tis enough that <hi>Joſeph</hi> is alive, 'tis enough if we may but enjoy our God. A Prince will part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing rather than he will part with his Crown-Jewels; and ſo will a Chriſtian rather part with any thing, than (upon choice to part) with his God, whom he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues above all the Crown-Jewels in the world. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> If God be moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to thee, then thou canſt never have enough of God, thou canſt never have enough of communion with God, thou canſt never have enough of the preſence of God,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62683:180"/>thou canſt never have enough of the Spirit of God,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 27.4. Pſal. 84. Pſa. 42.1, 2. Pſal. 63.1, 2, 3. Cant. 8.14. Rev. 22.20</note> thou canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have enough of the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, thou canſt never have enough of the aſſiſtance of God, thou canſt never have enough of the ſecret influences and incomes of God, thou canſt never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the comforts and ſtrong conſolations of God, &amp;c. The grave, the barren womb, the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſt, the Pope, the Turk, the Devil and hell will be as ſoon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, as thou canſt be ſatisfied without clearer, further, and fuller enjoyments of God.
<note place="margin">Exo. 33.20</note> 
               <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Moſes) can ſee my face, and live;</hi> upon which words <hi>Auſtine</hi> makes this ſhort, but ſweet reply, Then Lord let me die, that I may ſee thy face. 'Tis impoſſible that ever a mans heart ſhould reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, till he comes to a full and perfect enjoyment of that which he hath ſet up as his grand intereſt, as his great all. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If God be
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:62683:180"/>moſt precious to thee, then thou wilt give up thy ſelf wholly to God, without any reſervation. Whatever a man ſets up as his great intereſt, to that he devotes himſelf, to the ſervice of that he wholly gives up himſelf: So when a man eyes God as his moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intereſt, and ſets up God, as his moſt precious intereſt, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but devote himſelf wholly to God,
<note place="margin">Cant. 2.16. Acts 7.2, 3, 4. Acts 13.22. Luke 1.5, 6, 7.</note> he cannot but give up himſelf wholly to God; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.94. <hi>I am thine, ſave me,</hi> I am not my owne, nor ſinnes, nor Satans, nor the worlds, nor friends nor relations, but <hi>I am thine;</hi> I am really thine, I am wholly thine, I am onely thine, I am alwayes thine, I am thine to be ſanctified, and I am thine to be ſaved, I am thine to be commanded, and I am thine to be ruled; Lord, I am thine own, and therefore do with thine own as thou pleaſeſt, and diſpoſe of thine own as thou pleaſeſt, I am at thy foot, willing in ſome meaſure to be any thing or nothing, as ſhall
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:62683:181"/>ſeem beſt in thine own eyes. When the keys of the whole houſe, and of every room in the houſe are given up to the King to be at his diſpoſe, at his ſervice, then he is entertained as a King, and honoured as a King, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued and prized as a King: And ſo when all the keyes of the ſoul, and every room in the ſoul, and every faculty of the ſoul are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to God to be at his diſpoſe, at his ſervice, then God is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as a God, and honoured as a God, and valued and prized as a God, but not till then. And by theſe five hints (if you will not put a cheat upon your own ſouls) you may know whether God ſits in the uppermoſt room of your hearts, or no; and whether God be ſet up in your hearts above all, and whether he be indeed your great all, or your all in all. But</p>
            <p>Ninthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> If God be thy porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then there is no loſſe in all the world that lies ſo hard and ſo
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:62683:181"/>heavy upon thee, as the loſſe of thy God; there is no loſſe under heaven that doth ſo affect and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a man that hath God for his portion, as the loſſe of his God. <hi>David</hi> met with many a loſs, but no loſs made ſo ſad and ſo great a breach upon his ſpirit, as the loſſe of the face of God, the loſſe of the favour of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6, 7. <hi>In my proſperity I ſaid, I ſhall never be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Lord, by thy favour thou haſt made my mountain to ſtand ſtrong; thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled:</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Bahal</hi> ſignifies,
<note place="margin">And ſo this Hebrew word <hi>Bahal</hi> you have again in that <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.9. to expreſſe the greatneſſe of <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> trouble and terrour, when he ſaw the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing upon the wall, &amp; when none of his wiſe men could read the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp;c.</note> to be greatly troubled, to be ſorely terrified, as you may ſee in that 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.21. <hi>And the woman came unto</hi> Saul, <hi>and ſaw that he was ſore troubled:</hi> Here is the ſame Hebrew word <hi>Bahal. Saul</hi> was ſo terrified, affrighted, and diſ-animated with that dreadful news that the Devil in <hi>Samuels</hi> likeneſſe told him, that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:62683:182"/>his very vital ſpirits ſo failed him, that he fell into a fainting deadly ſwoon: And it was even ſo with <hi>David</hi> upon Gods hiding of his face; <hi>David</hi> was like a withered flower that had loſt all its ſap, life, and vigour, when God had wrapt up himſelf in a cloud. The life of ſome creatures lieth in the light and warmth of the Sun; and ſo doth the life of the Saints lie in the light and warmth of Gods countenance: And as in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of the Sun there is a droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the whole frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo when God hides his face, gracious ſouls cannot but droop and languiſh, &amp; bow down them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before him. Many inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures (ſome by opening and ſhutting, as Marigolds and Tulips, others by bowing and inclining the head, as the Solſequy and Mallow-flowers) are ſo ſenſible of the preſence and abſence of the Sun, that there ſeems to be ſuch a ſimpathy between the Sun and them, that if the Sun be gone or
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:62683:182"/>clouded, they wrap up themſelves, or hang down their heads, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to be ſeen by any eye but his that fills them; and juſt thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> when God had hid his face in a cloud. And it is very obſervable, that <hi>Job</hi> did bear up very ſweetly, bravely, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and nobly under all his great loſſes of children, eſtate, &amp;c. but when the arrows of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty were got within him, then he complains,
<note place="margin">Job. 6.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> that his grief was heavier than the ſands of the ſea: and when the face of God was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from him, how ſadly doth he lament and bewail the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God; <hi>Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 23.8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>but I cannot perceive him; on the left hand where he doth work, but I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him; he hideth himſelf on the right hand, that I cannot ſee him.</hi> You know there is no pain more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and tormenting, than that of breaking the bones: Now <hi>David</hi> again and again pitches upon this, to hint unto you that dreadful
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:62683:183"/>ſmart and pain that his ſoul was under,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 38.8. Pſa. 51.8.</note> when he had loſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and when his God was withdrawn from him, and had hid his face from him. And ſo the Church ſadly laments the loſſe of her beloved in that <hi>Solomons ſong</hi> 5.6. <hi>I opened to my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, but my beloved had withdrawn himſelf, and was gone; my ſoul failed when he ſpake;</hi> or <hi>he was gone, he was gone.</hi> Now this paſſionate dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſpeaks out her very great grief and trouble: Like a ſad widdow ſhe ſits down and wrings her hands, and cries out, <hi>he is gone, he is gone. My ſoul failed me,</hi> or as the Hebrew hath it, <hi>Naphſhi Jatſa, My ſoul went out of me,</hi> I was even as an aſtoniſhed creature, I was even as a dead creature, to note how greatly and how deeply ſhe was troubled and perplexed upon the account of his withdrawing from her.

Now God is a Chriſtians box of Jewels, he is a Chriſtians grand e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that he hath to ſhew for another world; and therefore his greateſt fear is of loſing his God, and his greateſt care is of keeping his God; If his box of Jewels be ſafe, then all is ſafe; but if they are loſt, all is loſt; and how then is it poſſible for a Chriſtian to bear up bravely under the loſſe of all?

<note place="margin">Act. 26.29</note> evidence thy propriety in God, in doing all thou canſt to provoke thoſe that are under thy charge to ſecure their propriety in God; other things cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, but propriety in God may be ſecured. If thou art a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that haſt a propriety in God,
<note place="margin">Joſh. 24.15</note> evidence it by doing all thou canſt by thy commands, and by thy counſel, and by thy example, and by thy prayers, to perſwade, and win others over to be reſtleſſe, till they have ſecured their intereſt and propriety in God. If thou art a father that haſt intereſt and propriety in God, O then let thy ſoul be ſtill in travail for thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, till Chriſt be formed in them, till they are new-born, and till they have experienced the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſweet of propriety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt

            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Evidence your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and intereſt in God, by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping far off from all ſuch ſinful courſes, practiſes, and compliances that may any ways put your ſelves or others to queſtion the truth of your propriety and intereſt in God. Thus did thoſe worthies, of whom this world was not worthy, in that <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
<note place="margin">Num. 4.5. to 13.</note> It is very obſervable that when the holy things belonging to the Sanctuary were to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, God commanded <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, that there ſhould be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care had to cover them all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, leſt in journeying duſt ſhould any wayes ſoil them. O beloved, it highly concerns you that have an intereſt and propriety in God, to look narrowly to your hearts, words, works, and wayes, and to ſee that there be ſuch a covering of grace and holineſſe, ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of care, fear, wiſdome, watchfulneſſe, and circumſpection over your whole man, that no ſcandalous ſins, pollutions, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:62683:195"/>be found upon you,
<note place="margin">Rev. 14.3, 4, 5. Chap. 3.4.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that exhortation of the Apoſtle, in that <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. <hi>That ye may be blameleſſe, and harmleſſe, the ſons of God, without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe nation, among whom ye ſhine</hi> (or <hi>ſhine ye</hi>) <hi>as lights in the world.</hi> I have read of the Dove, that there is ſuch a native dread of the Hawk implanted in her, that ſhe is afraid of every feather that hath grown upon a Hawk, and that ſhe ſo deteſts and abhors the very ſight of any ſuch feather, that ſhe will fly from it, and keep at the greateſt diſtance imaginable from it: And ſhall not that divine fear, O Chriſtians, that is planted by the hand of the Spirit in your hearts, be of as great a force and prevalency to keep your ſouls from all thoſe enormities and wicked compliances that may in the leaſt occaſion you or others to queſtion your propriety and intereſt? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. You know a Scrivener may by one great blot at laſt ſpoil all
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:62683:195"/>that he hath done for many dayes before upon a large Pattent or Leaſe; ſo a man may by one foul blot, by one enormous crime, by one wretched act of compliance, daſh and obliterate the faireſt copy of a vertuous life, and raze out all the viſible golden characters of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine graces, that once ſeemed to be printed upon the ſoul. Look, as one drop of ink coloureth a whole glaſſe of clear water; ſo one groſs ſin, one ſhameful action, one hours compliance with any thing of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt will colour and ſtain all the great things that ever you have ſuffered, and all the good things that ever you have performed; it will ſtain and colour all the good prayers that ever you have made, and all the good Sermons that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you have heard, and all the good books that ever you have read, and all the good words that ever you have ſpoke, and all the good works that ever you have done: And therefore whatever you do, keep off from ſinne, and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:62683:196"/>keep off from all ſinful complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as you would keep off from hell it ſelt. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Declare and evidence your propriety and intereſt in God by maintaining and keeping up the ſenſe of your intereſt and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in God, in oppoſition to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intereſt whatſoever; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your intereſt in God, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſins intereſt, and in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Satans intereſt,

<note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> and as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> did, and as <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, and as <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three Children did, and as the Apoſtles and the primitive Chriſtians did. Certainly the heart of a gracious man cannot but riſe,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.9. Pſa. 15.5.</note> and his anger and indignation cannot but ſwell againſt every thing and every inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that threatens to make a breach upon his intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:62683:196"/>in God. A man that hath an intereſt and propriety in God, in the midſt of all oppoſitions is like a man made up all of fire, walking in ſtubble and ſtraw, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes and conſumes all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and all difficulties are but whetſtones to his fortitude; he incourages his ſoul in the face of all oppoſitions and dangers, as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> once did his ſouldiers in that 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.7, 8. <hi>Be ſtrong and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, be not diſmayed for the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there be more with us, than with him: With him is an arm of fleſh, but with us is the Lord our God, to help us, and to fight our battels. And the people reſted themſelves upon the words of</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>King of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah. He is a fool, we ſay, that will be laughed out of his Coat; but certainly he is a fool in <hi>Folio</hi> that will be laughed out of his skin, nay, out of his ſoul, out of his profeſſion, out of his eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but doubtleſſe ſuch fools as theſe have never experienced
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:62683:197"/>the ſweet of propriety and intereſt in God. Without all peradventure there were many broad jeſts and many bitter ſcoffs broken upon <hi>Noah,</hi> whil'ſt he was a building of his Ark; the people laugh't at him, and derided him, and thought the poor old man doted and dreamed, not as we ſay of a dry Summer, but of a wet Winter: but yet <hi>Noahs</hi> propriety and intereſt in God being clear, <hi>Noah</hi> begins his work, and goes on his work, and never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes till he had finiſhed that work that God had ſet him about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alciat</hi> obſerves in one of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, that a dog then barketh moſt, when the Moon is at fulleſt; (but whether it be by ſome ſpecial influence that it then worketh in the dog; or whether it be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the ſpots in the Moon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto him in the forme and ſhape of another dog, I ſhall not conclude:) but yet let the dog bark never ſo much, the Moon will run her courſe, ſhe will walk her ſtation ſecurely through the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:62683:197"/>Heavens, though all the dogs in the Town bark never ſo fiercely at her; ſo a man that hath an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and propriety in God (and knows it) he is like the Moon, he will hold on his courſe heaven-wards, and holineſſe-wards, though all the lewd and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched wicked wretches in City and Countrey ſhould bark at him, and deride him, and oppoſe him, and ſpeak all manner of evil againſt him. Propriety and intereſt in God will make a man ſet light by all ſuch paper-ſhot, yea, it will carry him through the pikes, not onely of evil tongues, but it will alſo carry him through the moſt fierce and eager oppoſition that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satan himſelf, or any of his inſtruments can poſſibly raiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Declare and evidence your propriety and intereſt in God by your ſweet and noble carriage and deportment towards thoſe that have an intereſt and propriety
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:62683:198"/>in God. Look, as a child carries it in a different way to his Father to what he doth to others, ſo you muſt carry it in a different way towards thoſe that have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and propriety in God, to what you do towards thoſe that have no intereſt nor propriety at all in God. Though a wife be very kind and courteous to all comers and goers, yet ſhe carries it in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different way to her husband from what ſhe doth to all others, ſhe carries it with a great deal more kindneſſe, and ſweetneſſe, and tenderneſſe, and familiarneſſe, and nobleneſſe, &amp;c. towards her husband, than ſhe doth towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whether they be friends or ſtrangers: And juſt thus ſhould you carry it towards thoſe that have a propriety and intereſt in God. I have not faith enough to believe that ſuch men have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and propriety in God, who carry it very ſtrangely and proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and churliſhly, and ſcornfully, and deridingly, and tyrannically,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:62683:198"/>and diſdainfully, and enviouſly, and maliciouſly, and rigorouſly, and ſowrly, and bitterly, &amp;c. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that have an intereſt and propriety in God, and yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it at the ſame time very fairly, and ſweetly, and courteouſly, &amp;c. towards ſuch wretches that have no intereſt or propriety in God at all, yea, to ſuch that blaſpheme his Name, and that prophane his Sabbaths, and that pollute his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and that trample upon his mercies, and that deſpiſe his warnings, and that are given up to their own hearts luſts, and that live as if there were neither God, nor heaven, nor hell. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Evidence your intereſt and propriety in God, by doing ſuch things for God, which ſuch as have no intereſt in God cannot do, nor will not do, nor have no heart nor minde to do; evidence your intereſt in God,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.44, 45, 46, 47, 48.</note> by doing ſingular things for God, by doing ſuch things for God that are above
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:62683:199"/>their reach that have no intereſt nor propriety in God at all; As by denying your ſelves, your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſelves, your natural ſelves, and your religious ſelves; and by keeping a ſingular guard upon your owne hearts, words, and wayes; and by ſtepping over the Worlds Crown to take up Chriſts Croſſe,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did; and by leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves to greaten Chriſt, as <hi>John</hi> did;
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.30, 31, 32.</note> and by lifting up of Chriſt above your luſts, above your ſelves, above the world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove outward priviledges, above your performances, above your arts,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.7, 8, 9.</note> parts, and gifts, as <hi>Paul</hi> did; and by bleſſing a taking God as well as a giving God,
<note place="margin">Job 1.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> did; and by rejoycing and glorying in all the afflictions and ſufferings that befalls you for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpels ſake, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and primitive Chriſtians did; and by chuſing to ſuffer rather than to ſin,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> as thoſe Worthies did of whom this world was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; and by keeping of your
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:62683:199"/>ſelves from the defilements, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and abominations of the times, as ſome in <hi>Sardis</hi> did;
<note place="margin">Rev. 3.4.</note> and by following of the Lamb where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goes, as thoſe hundred fourty and four thouſand did, who had their fathers name written in their foreheads. O Sirs,
<note place="margin">Chap. 14.1, 2, 3. 4, 5.</note> it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better not to challenge any intereſt or propriety in God at all, then to pretend high as to intereſt and propriety in God, and yet to do no more for God (nay it may be not ſo much) than they that have no intereſt nor propriety in God at all. But</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Evidence your intereſt and propriety in God, by falling roundly in with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of God, in oppoſition to all carnal intereſts in the world. O Sirs, the intereſt of God will by degrees eat out and ſwallow up all other intereſts in the world. Look as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean kine eat up the ſat,
<note place="margin">Gen. 41.4. Exod. 7.11, 12.</note> and as <hi>Aarons</hi> rod ſwallowed up the Egyptians rods, ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62683:200"/>of God will in time eat up and ſwallow up all that ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous carnal worldly Antichriſtian and Satanical intereſt that men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour now to uphold with all their might;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 8 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.35. <hi>Then was the iron, the clay, the braſſe, the ſilver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the Summer threſhing-floors, and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them; and the ſtone that ſmote the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</hi> Verſe 44. <hi>And in the dayes of theſe Kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a Kingdom, which ſhall never be deſtroyed; and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall not be left to other people, but it ſhall break in pieces, and conſume all theſe Kingdomes, and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> And ſo, Chap. 7.27. <hi>And the Kingdom &amp; dominion, &amp; the greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High, whoſe Kingdom is an ever laſting Kingdome, and all Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall ſerve and obey him.</hi> Rev. 17.12, 13, 14. <hi>And the ten hornes which
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:62683:200"/>thou ſaweſt, are ten Kings, which have received no Kingdome as yet; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power as Kings one hour with the beaſt: theſe have one mind, and ſhall give their power and ſtrength unto the beaſt: theſe ſhall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall overcome them; for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, and they that are with him, are called, and choſen, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> If theſe Scriptures do not clearly evidence, that the intereſt of Chriſt ſhall ſwallow up all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intereſts, I underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Now mark, the people of God are the intereſt of God, and the Goſpel of God is the intereſt of God, and the Ordinances of God are the intereſt of God, and the inſtitutions and pure worſhip of God are the intereſt of God, &amp;c. And therefore all you that have an intereſt and propriety in God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence it by your ready and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute falling in with the intereſt of God. Believe it, they that fall in with the intereſt of God, fall in with the ſtrongeſt ſide, and will be
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:62683:201"/>ſure to carry it againſt ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds: What is the ſtubble to the flames? what is weakneſſe to ſtrength? what is impotency to omnipotency? what is folly to wiſdome? what is emptineſſe to fulneſſe? no more are all the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſts in the world to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of God; and therefore thrice happy is that man that falls time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cordially in with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of God.</p>
            <p>But now, if upon trial and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination any of you ſhall finde that yet the Lord is not your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (and this I believe will be the caſe of many of you) I would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all ſuch perſons to labour with all their might, yea, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as for life, to get the Lord to be their portion. O Sirs, this is the one thing neceſſary, this is the Sun among the ſtars, this is the work of works that lies upon your hands; when this is done all is done, till this be done there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done that will do you good

            <p>Now that I may the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually provoke you, and ſtir you up to this great and glorious, this neceſſary and weighty work, give me leave to propoſe theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that thy preſent portion, thy preſent condition is but miſerable and curſed:
<note place="margin">Levit. 26. Deut. 28.</note> All the earth was curſt upon mans fall, and till fallen man comes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in God, all his earthly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are curſt unto him, his honours are curſt, and his riches are curſt, and his preferments are curſt, and his pleaſures are curſt; the whole portion of his cup is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little curſed vanity, <hi>Job</hi> 20.23, 24, 25, 28, 29. <hi>When he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to fill his belly, God ſhall eaſt the

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:62683:202"/>every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi> And as there is a curſe upon all their ſouls, ſo there is a curſe upon all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, contentments, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that enjoy not God for their portion; till a man comes to enjoy God for his portion, all his earthly portions are curſt unto him, but when a man comes to enjoy God for his portion, then all his earthly portions are bleſt unto him. O Sirs, there is no mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the curſe, there is no rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the curſe, there is no alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the curſe, nor there is no taking of the curſe from off your ſouls, nor from off your earthly portions, but by gaining God to be your portion O Sirs you will live accurſed, and you will die ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, and you will appear before God accurſed, and you will be judged and ſentenced by God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, and you will be ſent to hell accurſed, and you will remain to all eternity accurſed, if God be

            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Conſider this, that there is yet a poſſibility of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to be thy portion;
<note place="margin">Mark 14.36. Luk. 18.27.</note> all the Angels in heaven, and all the men on earth do not know to the contrary, but that God may be thy portion, even thine. If thou art but heartily willing to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from that wicked Trinity, the World, the Fleſh, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, there is no doubt but God will be thy portion. O Sirs, why hath God laid open ſo clearly and ſo fully the nature and incomparable excellency of this portion above all other portions before you, but to perſwade your hearts, and to draw out your ſouls to look after this portion, and to make ſure this portion, as that wherein all your happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe lies? O that you were wiſe to conſider,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:62683:203"/>that now a prize, an opportunity is put into your hands that may make you for ever; you have all the wayes, and all the means, and all the helps, and all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges imaginable for the obtaining of God to be your portion, ſo that if God be not your portion, I ſhall be ſo bold to tell you,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 13.9.</note> that your deſtruction is from your ſelves. O Sirs, though God be a golden Myne,
<note place="margin">Pro. 2.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> yet he is ſuch a Myne that may be come at, if you will but dig, and ſweat, and take pains to purpoſe; though he be a pearl of infinite price, yet Chriſt can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe this Pearl for you; though he be a matchleſſe and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion, yet he is ſuch a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as may be yours, as will be yours, if you are not wanting to your own ſouls. Why hath God ſent his Ambaſſadours early and late? and why hath he,

But</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Conſider that God is a portion-ſweetning portion; God is ſuch a portion as will ſweeten all other portions; he is a portion that will make every pleaſant por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more pleaſant, and that will make every bitter portion ſweet.

            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Conſider that all earthly portions are not of that infinite conſequence and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you, as this portion is; all earthly portions are but the meat that periſheth,
<note place="margin">John 6.27. Matt. 6.19. James 5.3. Eccleſ. 1.</note> they are but moth-eaten and canker-eaten treaſures, they are full of uncertainty, yea, they are all over vanity, they reach not beyond the line of this mortal life; they can neither fuit the ſoul, nor fill the ſoul, nor ſatisfie the ſoul, nor ſave the ſoul; they can neither change the heart, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the heart, nor in the leaſt better the heart; they can neither arm a man againſt temptations, nor lead a man out of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor make a man victorious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver temptations; they can neither direct the conſcience when 'tis in

By all which it is moſt evident that all earthly portions are of very little conſequence and concernment to the ſons of men, to the ſouls of men.

No man can hear as he ſhould, nor pray as he ſhould, nor live as he ſhould, nor die as

O Sirs, it is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that you ſhould have this or that earthly portion, but 'tis abſolutely neceſſary that you ſhould have God for your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for if God be not your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all the Angels in heaven, nor all the men on earth cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your being miſerable to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>

If ever you would have God for your portion, you muſt ſay to all your wanton lovers, and to all thoſe Idols of jealouſie that you have ſet up in your ſouls, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> once ſaid to his, <hi>Get you hence, for what have I any more to do with you,</hi> Hoſ. 14.8. But</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> If you would have God for your portion, then you muſt wait upon him in the uſe of all holy means;
<note place="margin">In my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes I have ſpoken very large<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly about the uſe of holy means, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in my laſt on <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and therefore a touch here muſt ſuffice.</note> in the uſe of holy meanes God makes the cleareſt, the fulleſt, and the choiceſt diſcoveries of himſelf; in the uſe of holy means poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:62683:215"/>come to be acquainted with the excellency of God, and with the neceſſity of having God for their portion; in the uſe of holy means poor ſinners come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the fulneſſe of God, the goodneſſe of God, the graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, the ſweetneſſe of God, and the wonderful freeneſſe, readineſſe, and willingneſſe of God to give himſelf as a portion to all ſuch as ſee their need of him, and that are heartily willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as their God and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in the uſe of holy means God works in poor ſinners a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a forwardneſſe, and a bleſſed willingneſſe to chooſe God for their portion, to cloſe with God for their portion, to imbrace God for their portion, to accept of God for their portion, and to own God for their portion. If this queſtion ſhould be put to all the Saints in heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> How God came to be their portion? they would all anſwer, by waiting upon him in the uſe of all thoſe holy wayes
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:62683:216"/>and means that he had appointed for that purpoſe; and if the ſame queſtion were put to all the Saints on earth that have God for their portion, they would all give the ſame anſwer. O Sirs, as ever you would have God for your portion, it highly concerns you to wait patiently upon him in the uſe of all holy means; he that is in the uſe of holy means is in the way of obtaining God for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But he that caſts off the uſe of the means, he ſays in effect, I will not have God for my portion, I care not to have God for my portion; let me but have the world for my portion, and let who will take God for their portion.</p>
            <p>To prevent miſtakes, before I cloſe up this direction, remember that by the uſe of holy means, I onely mean ſuch means that God himſelf hath appointed, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, inſtituted, and ordained. As for thoſe means that are of mens inventing, deviſing, preſcribing, commanding, and ordaining, a
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:62683:216"/>man may wait till doomſ-day in the uſe of them before ever he will gain God for his portion; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are rather to be declined, yea, deteſted and abhorred, than any way to be owned, minded, or uſed by any that would have God for their portion. Look, as all the worſhippers of <hi>Baal</hi> got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by all their wailing and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from morning to night,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 18.</note> 
               <hi>O Baal, hear us, O Baal, hear us;</hi> So they that wait upon God in inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and deviſed worſhip will never get any thing by all their waiting; no, though they ſhould wait from morning to evening, and from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening to morning, and cut and launce themſelves till the blood guſh out, as thoſe fooliſh worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of <hi>Baal</hi> did. And therefore as ever you would have God for your portion, be ſure that you wait upon him onely in his own wayes, and in the uſe of his own means. And thus I have done with the Uſe and Application of the Point.</p>
            <pb n="396" facs="tcp:62683:217"/>
            <p>So that I have now nothing to do, but theſe two things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, To anſwer a few Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that poor ſinners are apt to make againſt their own ſouls, and againſt their enjoying of God for their portion. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, To lay down a few Poſitions that may be of ſingular uſe to all ſuch that have God for their portion. I ſhall begin with the Objections.</p>
            <p>Methinks I hear ſome poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ready to object and ſay,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> O Sir, you have preſt us by many motives to get God for our porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we ſtand convinced in ſome meaſure by what you have ſaid, that God is a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, tranſcendent, glorious porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but we very much queſtion whether ever God will beſtow himſelf as a portion upon ſuch great, ſuch grievous, ſuch notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſuch infamous ſinners as we are?</p>
            <pb n="397" facs="tcp:62683:217"/>
            <p>Now to this Objection I ſhall return theſe anſwers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God is a free agent,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and therefore he may give himſelf as a portion to whom he pleaſes; men may do with their own as they pleaſe, and ſo may God do with himſelf as he pleaſes. Look as men may give earthly portions to whom they pleaſe; ſo God may give himſelf as a portion to what ſinners he pleaſes; God is as free to beſtow himſelf upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of ſinners, as he is to beſtow himſelf upon the leaſt of ſinners. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the Lord hath beſtowed himſelf as a portion upon as great and as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinners as you are.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.18.</note>

               <hi>Adam</hi> you know fell from the higheſt pinnacle of glory into the greateſt gulf of miſery, and yet God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed himſelf as a portion upon him:
<note place="margin">2 Kings 21.</note> And <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was a ſinner of the greateſt magnitude, his ſins were of a skarlet dye, they reach't

<note place="margin">2 Chron. 33.</note> and they made his ſoul as black as hell; for Witchcraft, Sorcery, Cruelty, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and Blood, he was a none<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch; he ſold himſelf to work all manner of wickedneſſe with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe; he did more wickedly than the very heathen, whom the Lord abhorred; in all his actings he ſeemed to be the firſt-born of Satans ſtrength; and yet the Lord freely beſtowed himſelf as a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him: and ſo, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6, 8. <hi>When I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thine own blood, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood live, yea, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood live.

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:62683:218"/>and my ſalvation ſhall not tarry; and I will place ſalvation in</hi> Zion <hi>for</hi> Iſrael <hi>my glory. Solomon, Mary Magdalen, Mathew, Zacheus,</hi> the Gaoler, and the murderers of Chriſt were all very great and grievous ſinners, and yet the Lord beſtowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a portion upon them; and ſo God beſtowed himſelf as a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon thoſe monſtrous and prodigious ſinners that are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>whoſe ſouls were red with guilt, and as black as hell with filth.</hi> God hath been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good to thoſe that have been very bad, and therefore do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, O ſinner, though thy ſins are very great.</p>
            <p>I have read a Story concerning a great Rebel that had made a great party againſt one of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:62683:219"/>Emperour, demands the ſum of money propoſed; the Emperour bethinking himſelf, concludes, that if he ſhould put him to death, all the world would be ready to ſay, that he did it to ſave his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and ſo he freely pardoned the Rebel, and gave him the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Here now was light in a dark Lanthorn, here was rare mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and pity in a very Heathen: And ſhall an Heathen do thus, and ſhall not the great God, who is made up of all loves, of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, of all compaſſions, of all goodneſſes, and of all ſweetneſſes, do much more? certainly he will. If the greateſt Rebels, if the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinners will but come in whilſt the white Flag of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is held forth, they ſhall finde a marvcilous readineſſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe in God, not onely to pardon them, but alſo to beſtow (not onely money, but) himſelf as a portion upon them. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinners ſhould do well to make that great Scripture their greateſt
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:62683:219"/>companion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>thou haſt led captivity captive, thou haſt received gifts for men, yea, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious alſo,</hi> (but to what purpoſe hath Chriſt received gifts, ſpiritual gifts, gracious gifts, glorious gifts, for men, for the rebellious? why 'tis) <hi>that the Lord God may dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that God hath given out an expreſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he will make ſuch to be his people which were not his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.23. <hi>I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy, and I will ſay to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God.</hi> In this precious promiſe God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf to have a moſt ſweet harmony, and a moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate conjunction and communion with ſuch a people as were not his people. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I anſwer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that God
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:62683:220"/>gains the greateſt glory, by beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf as a portion upon the greateſt ſinners. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that makes ſo much for the glory of free grace, and for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of rich mercy, and for the praiſe of divine goodneſſe, and for the honour of infinite fulnſſe, as Gods beſtowing of himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the greateſt of ſinners. O Sirs, grace appears never ſo rich, nor never ſo excellent, nor never ſo glorious, as when it triumphs over the greateſt ſins, and when it falls upon the greateſt ſinners: Grace never ſhines, nor never ſparkles, nor never becomes ſo exceeding glorious, as it doth when it lights upon the hearts of the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The greateſt ſinnes do moſt and beſt ſet off the freeneſſe and the riches of Gods grace; there is nothing that makes heaven and earth to ring and to ſound out his praiſes ſo much as the fixing of his love upon thoſe that are moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely and uncomely, and as the beſtowing of himſelf upon them
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:62683:220"/>that have given away themſelves from him.</p>
            <p>And 'tis further obſervable, that the greateſt ſinners, when once they are converted, do commonly prove the choiceſt Saints, and the rareſt Inſtruments of promoting the honour and glory of God in the world. The <hi>Canaanites</hi> were a wicked and a curſed generation,
<note place="margin">They were of the race of curſed <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </note> they were given over to all whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, witchcraft, and cruelty, they offered their ſons and daughters to Devils, they were the very worſt of ſinners, they were without God, and without the Covenant, and counted dogs among the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and ſuch an one was the <hi>Canaanite</hi> woman that you read of in that <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.21-29. till the Lord made it the day of his power upon her ſoul; but when the Lord had brought her in to himſelf, ah what a rare Chriſtian did ſhe prove, for wiſdome, zeal, humility, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, love, courage, patience, faith, &amp;c. And ſo <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was a notorious Strumpet, a common
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:62683:221"/>whore, among all the harlots none to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 16 9</note> and ſhe was one out of whom Chriſt caſt ſeven Devils; and yet when ſhe was changed and converted,
<note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> O with what an inflamed love did ſhe love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt! and with what a burning zeal did ſhe follow after the Lord Jeſus! and how abundant was ſhe in her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and mourning after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt!
<note place="margin">Joh. 20.</note> Some report, that after our Saviours reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe ſpent thirty years in weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her ſins in <hi>Galba.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> you know, was a very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinner, but after his converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, O what a rare, what an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, what a glorious inſtrument was he in bringing of ſouls to Chriſt, and in building up of ſouls in Chriſt!
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.</note> O what a noble drudge was he for Chriſt! O how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent! O how fervent! O how abundant was he in the work of the Lord, &amp;c. And indeed in all ages, the greateſt ſinners when once they have been converted,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:62683:221"/>they have commonly proved the choiceſt Saints, and the rareſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the hand of God for the advancement of his glory, and the carrying on of his work in the world. I might inſtance in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and divers others, but that I haſten to a Cloſe: And therefore,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I anſwer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that of all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners the greateſt ſinners do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſtand in the greateſt need of having of God for their portion. Look, as they that are moſt wounded ſtand in moſt need of a Surgeon, and as they that are moſt ſick ſtand in moſt need of a Phyſician, and as they that are in moſt danger of robbing, ſtand in moſt need of aſſiſtance; and as they that are in moſt peril of drowning ſtand in moſt need of a boat, and as they that are moſt impoveriſhed ſtand in moſt need of relief, ſo they that are the greateſt ſinners ſtand in moſt need of having of God for their portion, for no tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,
<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1, 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> nor no heart can conceive the greatneſſe of that wrath, of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:62683:222"/>that indignation, of that deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of that deſtruction, and of that damnation that attends and waits upon thoſe great ſinners that have not God for their portion; and therefore the greater ſinner thou art, the greater obligation lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee to get God to be thy God and portion; for till that be done, all thy ſins in their full number, weight, guilt, and aggravating circumſtances will abide upon thy ſoul. But</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> I anſwer, that God is a great God, and he loves to do like himſelf. Now there are no works, no actions that are ſo ſuitable to God, and ſo pleaſing to God, and ſo delightful to God, as thoſe that are great; and what greater work, what greater action can the great God do, than to beſtow himſelf as a portion upon the greateſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? It was a great work for God to create the world, and it is a great work for God to govern the World, and it will be a great
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:62683:222"/>work for God to diſſolve the world, and to raiſe the dead; and yet doubtleſſe it is a greater work for the great God freely to beſtow himſelf upon the greateſt ſinners. The love of God is a great love, and the mercies of God are great mercies, and the compaſſions of God are great compaſſions, and accordingly God loves to act; and therefore there is ground for the greateſt ſinners to hope that the Lord may beſtow himſelf as a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them. But</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> Others may object and ſay, hereafter we will look after this portion; for the preſent we are for living in the world, we are for a portion in hand, we are for laying up portions for our ſelves, and providing portions for our poſterity; we are firſt for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of earthly treaſures, and when we have done that work to purpoſe, then we will do what we can to obtain this excellent and glorious portion that you have

            <p>Thirdly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>3</label> Others may object and ſay, we would fain have God for our portion, and we would willingly apply our ſelves to all thoſe wayes and means whereby we might obtain the Lord to be our portion; but we are poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy wretches, ſurely the Lord will never beſtow himſelf as a portion upon ſuch miſerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ones as we are; we are worthy of death, we are worthy of wrath, we are worthy of hell, we are worthy of damnation, but we are no wayes worthy of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God for our portion. Did ever the Lord caſt an eye of love upon ſuch unlovely, and ſuch unworthy ſinners, Lepers, as we are? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now to this Objection I ſhall return theſe anſwers:</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Though you have no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.15. 1 Tim. 1.14. 1 Pet. 1.3.</note> yet God is rich, and abundant in mercy; your ſins, your unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe can but reach as high as heaven, but the mercies of God
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:62683:226"/>reach above the heavens, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.11. <hi>For as the Heaven is high above the earth, ſo great is his mercy toward them that fear him:</hi> Pſal. 108.4. <hi>For thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds:</hi> The higheſt compariſons which the world will afford are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to expreſſe the greatneſſe of Gods mercy to poor ſinners: Though the heavens are exceeding high above the earth, yet the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God to his poor people are above the heavens. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the Lord hath never beſtowed himſelf as a portion upon any yet, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ones; <hi>David</hi> was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy as <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> as <hi>Joab,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> as <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21.31, 32.</note> and the Publicans and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots that entered into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven were as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as the Publicans and Harlots that were ſhut out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven; and the thief that went to paradiſe was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:62683:227"/>as the thief that went to hell: All the Saints in heaven, and all the Saints on earth are ready with one joynt conſent to declare, that they were as unworthy as the moſt unworthieſt, when God firſt beſtowed himſelf as a portion upon them. This Objection, I am unworthy, is a very unworthy Objection, and therefore away with it. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I anſwer, that God hath no where in all the Scripture required any perſonal worthineſſe to be in the creature, before he will beſtow himſelf upon the creature. O Sirs, it never came into the thoughts of God, it never entered into the heart of God to require of men, that they ſhould be firſt worthy of his love, before they ſhould enjoy his love; and that they ſhould be firſt worthy of his mercy, before they ſhould taſt of his mercy; and that they ſhould be firſt worthy of his goodneſſe, before they ſhould be partakers of
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:62683:227"/>his goodneſſe; and that they ſhould be firſt worthy of himſelf, before he would beſtow himſelf as a portion upon them. If we ſhould never enjoy God for our portion till we are worthy to enjoy him for our portion, we ſhould never enjoy him. If a man had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eyes as <hi>Argus</hi> to ſearch into the Scripture, and as many hands as <hi>Briareus</hi> to turn over the leaves of Scripture, yet he would never be able to find out one Text, one line, yea, one word, wherein God requires a perſonal worthineſſe in the creature, before he gives away himſelf to the creature: Should God ſtand upon a perſonal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe to be in the creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would look upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or before he would let out his love to the creature, or before he would extend mercy or pity to the creature, or before he would in a Covenant of free grace give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the creature, no ſinner could be ſaved, man would be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver undone, and it had been good
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:62683:228"/>for him that he had never been born. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I anſwer, 'tis not mens unworthineſſe, but mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe that hinders them from having God to be their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though moſt men pretend their unworthineſſe, yet there is in them a ſecret unwillingneſſe to have God for their God. When they look upon God, as a gracious God, then they are willing to have him to be their God; but when they look upon God as an holy God, then their hearts fly back: when they look upon God as a merciful God, and as a bountiful God, O then they wiſh that he were their God; but when they look upon God as a commanding God, and as a ruling and an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling God, O then their hearts do ſecretly riſe againſt God; there is a real unwillingneſſe in the hearts of ſinners, in all reſpects, to cloſe with God, and to have God to be their God.

<note place="margin">Deut. 30.15, 19.</note> life and death hath been often ſet before me, and I have choſen death rather than life; heaven and hell hath been often ſet before me, and I have choſen hell rather than heaven; glory and miſery hath been often ſet before me, and I have choſen miſery rather than glory; and therefore 'tis but juſt that I ſhould be miſerable to all eternity.

            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, I anſwer, that if you will not ſeek after the Lord to be your portion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> till you are worthy to enjoy him as your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then you will never ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, then you will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him for your God and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: perſonal worthineſſe is no flower that growes in Natures gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, no man is born with a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe in his heart, as he is born with a tongue in his mouth; 'tis not the full, but the empty, 'tis not the rich, but the poor in ſpirit; 'tis not the righteous, but the ſinner; 'tis not the worthy, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſoul that is the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mercy and pity: The poor Publican that cried out, <hi>Lord, be merciful to me a ſinner,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 18.10-15.</note> went home juſtified, when the thank-God Phariſee returned as proud as he came. The <hi>Centurion</hi> when he came to Chriſt, ſped well,
<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his perſonal unworthineſs.
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:62683:230"/>And the prodigal ſon ſped well when he returned to his Father,
<note place="margin">Luk. 15.11—ult.</note> notwithſtanding his perſonal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs; for he was readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, greatly pitied, ſweetly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, courteouſly received, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry joyfully and nobly entertained, witneſſe the beſt robe that was put upon his back, and the gold ring that was put on his finger, and the ſhoes that were put on his feet, and the fatted calfe that was killed to make the company merry. O Sirs, if in the face of all your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe you will go to God, and tell him that you are ſinners, that you are vile ſinners, that you are wretched ſinners, that you are very great ſinners, yea, that you are the greateſt of ſinners, and that you have deſerved a thouſand deaths, a thouſand hells, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand deſtructions, and a thouſand damnations, and earneſtly beſeech him to look upon you, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow himſelf on you (though not for your worthineſſe ſake, yet) for his Names ſake, for his mercies
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:62683:230"/>ſake, for his promiſe ſake, for his Covenants ſake, for his Oath ſake, and for his Sons ſake; Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you ſhall thus plead with God, all the Angels in heaven, and all the men on earth cannot tell to the contrary, but that you may ſpeed as well as ever the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion,</hi> or the Prodigal did. I have taken the more pains to anſwer this Objection, that ſo it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a reſurrection more in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your hearts, into whoſe hands this Treatiſe may fall.</p>
            <p>I know other Objections might be raiſed, but becauſe I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken largely to ſuch in my former writings. I ſhall paſs on to the laſt thing propoſed, and that is to lay down ſome Poſitions that may (by the bleſſing of God) be of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe to the Chriſtian Reader.</p>
            <p>As firſt, That 'tis one thing for a man to have God for his portion,
<note place="margin">Firſt Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Moſes</hi> his face did ſhine, and yet he did not ſee it.</note> and 'tis another thing for a man to have an aſſurance in his own ſoul that God is his portion; there are many that have God for their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:62683:231"/>who yetare full of fears and doubts, that God is not their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Thus it was with <hi>Aſaph</hi> in that 77 <hi>Pſalm;</hi> &amp; thus it was with <hi>Heman</hi> in that 88 <hi>Pſalm;</hi> and thus it is with very many Chriſtians in theſe dayes. Sometimes God exerciſes his children with ſuch changeable and ſuch terrible diſpenſations as raiſes many fears and doubts in them about their intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in; God and ſometimes their ſecret indulging of ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Idol, their entertainment of ſome predominant luſt, raiſes ſtrange fears and jealouſies in their ſouls about their intereſt in God; and ſometimes their not cloſing with the Lord ſo cloſely, ſo fully, ſo faithfully, ſo univerſally, and ſo ſincerely as they ſhould, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſecret reſervation, raiſes many doubts and queſtions in them, whether God be their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or no. The graces of many Chriſtians are ſo weak, and their corruptions are ſo ſtrong, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is ſo buſie with them, and their
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:62683:231"/>duties and performances are ſo weak, ſo flat, ſo dull, ſo ſapleſſe, ſo liveleſſe, ſo fruitleſſe, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, that they are ready at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very turn to ſay, if God be our God, why is it thus with us? if God be our portion, why are our hearts in no better a frame? why have our duties no more ſpirit, life, and fire in them. Look, as the Sun may ſhine, and yet I not ſee it; and as the husband may be in the houſe, and yet the wife not know it; and as the child may have a very great portion, a very fair e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſetled upon him, and yet he not underſtand it; ſo a Chriſtian may have God for his portion, and yet for the preſent he may not ſee it, nor know it, nor underſtand it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the Name of the Son of God.</hi> Theſe precious ſouls had God and Chriſt for their portion, and they did believe, and they had
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:62683:232"/>eternal life in the ſeeds and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of it, and in the promiſe, and in Chriſt their Head,
<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.6.</note> who as a publick perſon had taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it in their ſteads, and yet they had not the aſſurance of theſe things in their own ſouls. Look, as the babe that hath paſt the pangs of the firſt birth, doth not preſently cry out, my father, my father; ſo the babe of grace, the new-born Chriſtian doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cry out, my God, my God; 'tis one mercy for God to be my God, and 'tis another mercy for God to tell me, that he is my God; 'tis one act of grace for God to be my portion, and 'tis another act of grace for God to tell me, that he is my portion. Look, as fire may be hid under aſhes for a time, and as bits of gold may be hid in an heap of duſt for a time, and as ſtars may be hid in a dark night for a time, and as a pearl may be hid in a puddle for a time; ſo God may be a mans portion, and yet this may be hid from him for a time.</p>
            <pb n="427" facs="tcp:62683:232"/>
            <p>The ſecond Poſition is this,
<note place="margin">Second Poſition.</note> That it is one thing for a man to have God for his portion, and another thing for a man clearly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly to make it out to himſelf or others, that God is his portion: Doubtleſſe there are many thouſands that have God for their portion, who yet,
<note place="margin">God ſometimes layes ſuch a Law of reſtraint upon the noble faculties of men and women, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uſe them at ſometimes as they do at others, as you may clearly ſee by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of theſe Scriptures together, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.14, 15, 16, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.9. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.16, 19. <hi>John</hi> 20.14, 15, &amp;c.</note> if you would give them a thouſand worlds, are not able to make it out to their own or others ſatisfaction, that God is their portion. Moſt Chriſtians attain to but ſmall meaſures of grace, but little mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace: Now ſmall things, little things are hardly diſcerned, they are hardly made out. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith is next to no faith, and a little love is next to no love, and a little repentance is next to no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and a little zeal is next to no zeal, and a little hope is next to no hope, and a little holineſſe is
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:62683:233"/>next to no holineſſe, and a little communion with God is next to no communion with God, and a little conformity to God is next to no conformity to God. Now where there is but a little grace, there it is very difficult for a man to make out the truth of his grace, and ſo by conſequence to make out the truth of his intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the God of grace: 'Tis not grace in truth, but grace in ſtrength that will inable a man to make it out to himſelf, and to make it out to others, that God is his portion: It is not grace in its ſincerity, but grace in its ſublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in its high and eminent actings, that will inable a man to make it out to himſelf and others, that God is indeed his God. Beſides, many precious hearts have ſuch weak heads, and ſuch bad Logick, and ſuch ſhallow natural parts, that they are not able rationally nor divinely to argue the caſe with their own ſouls, nor to make an improvement of thoſe rules, helps,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:62683:233"/>wayes, and means, whereby they might be inabled to make it out to themſelves and others, that God is their portion. Look, as many perſons have often a good title to ſuch and ſuch lands, and to ſuch and ſuch eſtates and inheritances, though they are not able for the preſent to clear up their title either to themſelves or others; ſo many of the dear children of God have a good title to God, and a real inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and propriety in God, and yet for the preſent they are not able to clear up their title to God, nor to clear up their intereſt and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in God, either to themſelves or others. And this is ſo great a truth, that all the faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt that deal with poor ſouls, &amp; that are converſant about ſouls, are ready from their daily experience to avouch it before all the world. He that ſhall ſay, that ſuch have not God for their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that cannot make out God to be their portion, will certainly condemn the generation of the juſt.</p>
            <pb n="430" facs="tcp:62683:234"/>
            <p>The third Poſition is this,
<note place="margin">Third Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> That where there is an hearty willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in any man to accept of God to be his God,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.1, 2. Joh. 7.37, 38.</note> to own God for his God, and to cloſe with God as his God, there God is certainly that mans God. If there be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial willingneſſe in you to take God to be your God, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all peradventure God is your God. A ſincere willingneſſe to accept of God to be your God is accepted of God, and is ſufficient to enter into a gracious Covenant with God. O Sirs, a ſincere wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to accept of God to be your God flowes from nothing below the good will and pleaſure of God; no power below that glorious power that made the world, and that raiſed Chriſt from the grave, is able to raiſe a ſincere, an hearty willingneſſe in man to accept of God to be his God, and to take God for his God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing</hi> (or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſes in the abſtract, and in the plural number,) <hi>in the day of thy
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:62683:234"/>power, in the beauties of holineſſe.</hi> There is no power below the power of the Lord of Hoſts that can raiſe up a willingneſſe in the hearts of ſinners: 'tis not in the power of all the Angels in heaven, nor of all the men on earth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a ſincere willingneſſe in the heart of man to accept of God to be his God; this is work that can only be effected by an omnipotent hand. Though an Emperour may force a woman to marry him that is his ſlave, becauſe ſhe is his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, yet he cannot by all his power force her will; he may force her body to the action, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not force her will to the action. The will is alwayes free, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forced, but God is that great Emperour that hath not onely a power to marry the ſoul (which he hath redeemed from being Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans bond-ſlave) but alſo a power to make the ſoul that is unready ready, and that is unwilling wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to marry him, and to beſtow it ſelf freely upon him. If there
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:62683:235"/>be in thee, O man, O woman, a ſincere willingneſſe to take God upon his own terms to be thy God (that is, to take him as an holy God, and as a ruling God, and as a commanding God in one thing as well as another) then he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thy God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come; and let him that heareth ſay, come; and let him that is athirſt, come; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will let him take the water of life freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Poſition is this,
<note place="margin">Fourth Poſition.</note> That it may ſo fall out, that ſuch a Chriſtian that hath God for his portion, that hath an intereſt and a propriety in God, may loſe the ſight, the ſenſe, the feeling and the evidence of his intereſt and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in God; and this is evident by comparing the Scriptures in the Margin together.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.6, 7. Pſal. 51.13. Joh. 24. Ch. 16.9. &amp; Ch. 19.10, 11.</note> Doubtleſſe it is very rare to find a Chriſtian that hath had the knowledge, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and evidence of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and propriety in God, but that
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:62683:235"/>that Chriſtian alſo hath experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced what it is to have his intereſt and propriety in God clouded and darkned.
<note place="margin">And Ch. 30.20. Pſal. 77. Pſal. 88. Iſa. 8.17. Lam. 3.18.</note> Such Chriſtians that have experienced what the warm beams of the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe means, have likewiſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced what it is to have their Sun ſet in a Cloud; and this truth I might make good, by producing of a cloud of witneſſes both from among the Martyrs, and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints in all Ages. But what do I talk of a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, when the tears that daily drop from many of your eyes, and the ſad complaints, and ſighs, and groans of many of your ſouls do ſufficiently evidence this ſad truth. And therefore let no man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God is not his God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath loſt the ſight and ſenſe of his intereſt and propriety in God; let no man ſay, that God is not his portion, becauſe he hath loſt thoſe evidences (at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) by which he hath formerly proved God to be his portion.
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:62683:236"/>Though a man ſhould loſe his Writings and Evidences that he hath to ſhew for ſuch or ſuch an Eſtate, yet his Writings and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences being inrolled in a Court of Record, his Eſtate remains good, and his Title is ſtill good in law; and therefore there is no reaſon why ſuch a man ſhould ſit down, and wring his hands, and cry out, I am undone, I am undone: ſo though a Chriſtian ſhould loſe his Writings, his Evidences that once he had to ſhew, that once he had to prove God to be his God and portion, and that he had a real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and propriety in God, yet his Writings, his Evidences being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in the Court of Heaven, his title to God, his intereſt in God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains good; and therefore there is no reaſon why ſuch a perſon ſhould ſit down dejected, and wring his hands, and cry out, O I am undone, I am for ever undone.</p>
            <p>The fifth Poſition is this,
<note place="margin">Fifth Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> That ſuch that have not (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:62683:236"/>God for their portion, ought not peremptorily to conclude, that they ſhall never have God for their portion; ſuch a perſon that cannot yet truly ſay, that the Lord is his portion ought not to deſpair of ever having of God for his portion. The time of a mans life is but a day, and God may beſtow himſelf as a portion upon man in what hour of that day he pleaſes. In the Parable he beſtowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a portion upon ſome at the firſt hour,

            <pb n="443" facs="tcp:62683:240"/>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of the Saints both in the Old and New Teſtament doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as much, <hi>Solomons Song</hi> 2.16. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> Chap. 6.3. <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine:</hi> And Chap. 7.10. <hi>I am my beloveds, and his deſire is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. Iſa.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſſe thou art our Father, though</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of us, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>acknowledge us not; thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer, thy Name is from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> Iſa. 64.8, 9. <hi>But now, O Lord, thou art our Father, behold, ſee, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, we are all thy people.</hi> Jer. 3.22, 23. <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God. Truly in the Lord our God is the ſalvation of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. Iſa. 25.9. <hi>And it ſhall be ſaid in that day, Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us.</hi> I might produce a cloud of witneſſes from among the Patriarchs and Prophets, further to evince this truth; but enough is as good as a Feaſt.</p>
            <pb n="444" facs="tcp:62683:241"/>
            <p>And as the Church of God in the Old Teſtament, ſo the Church of God in the New Teſtament at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the ſame aſſurance. The believers in <hi>Corinth</hi> were ſealed, and had the earneſt of the Spirit in their hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi> And Chap. 5.1, 5. <hi>For we know, that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. Now he that hath wrought us for the ſelf-ſame thing is God, who alſo hath given us the earneſt of the Spirit.</hi> And ſo the believing <hi>Epheſians</hi> had the like, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom, after ye believed ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of Promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance.</hi> And ſo, Chap. 4.30. <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> And the believing <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> had the ſame, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. For our Goſpel came not unto you in word onely, but alſo in
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:62683:241"/>power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance.</hi> I might give you many particular inſtances out of the New Teſtament to confirm this truth, but theſe general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are more convincing and ſatisfying.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If God ſhould not firſt or laſt, ſooner or later, mediately or immediately give his people ſome comfortable aſſurance, that he is their portion, and that they have a real intereſt and propriety in him, the ſpirits, the ſouls of his people would certainly faint and fail; but this God will never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, this God by promiſe hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf to prevent, as you may ſee in that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 16, 18, 19. <hi>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be alwayes wrath; for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made. I have ſeen his wayes, and will heal him: I will lead him alſo, and reſtore comforts unto him, and to his mourners: I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:62683:242"/>afar off, and to him that is neer, ſaith the Lord, and I will heal him.</hi> Now ſeeing that God hath ſo graciouſly undertaken for his people, that their ſpirits ſhall not faint nor fail, there is no doubt but that ſooner or later, more or leſſe, God will aſſure his people that he is their portion, and that they have a real intereſt and propriety in him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Lords Supper is a ſealing Ordinance, and was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
<note place="margin">Matth. 26.26, 27, 28. 1 Cor. 11.23, 24. Rom. 4.11.</note> inſtituted, and appointed for that very purpoſe and to that very end, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſeal up the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers propriety in God, and to aſſure him of his intereſt in God, in Chriſt, in the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and in all the benefits of Chriſts death, to wit, the favour of God, reconciliation, redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the remiſſion of ſins. Now how can it poſſibly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that ſo glorious an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhould be inſtituted to ſo great and ſo glorious an end as to aſſure believers of their intereſt
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:62683:242"/>and propriety in God, and yet this end ſhould never be effected in them all their dayes, for whoſe ſake the Ordinance was inſtituted and appointed. Certainly God never appointed any Ordinance to accompliſh any end,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.10, 11. Ch. 45.23.</note> but firſt or laſt that Ordinance did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh that end, for which it was appointed and inſtituted.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cy. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Ep.</hi> 6. The ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reports, <hi>Aug. in Joh Tract.</hi> 27.</note> 
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſhews how the Martyrs in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church when they were to appear before the cruel perſecuting Tyrants, were wont to receive the Lords Supper, and thereby they were ſo aſſured of their intereſt and propriety in God, and ſo fired with zeal and fervour, and fill'd with faith and fortitude, &amp;c. that they made nothing of the greateſt torments that thoſe bloody Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants could inflict upon them. And ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper we are ſo armed againſt Satans tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, that he fleeth from us, as if we were ſo many Lions that ſpet fire.</p>
            <pb n="448" facs="tcp:62683:243"/>
            <p>The Jews in the celebration of the Paſſeover did ſing the 113. Pſalm, with the five following Pſalms, which they called the great <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> and it was always after that cup of wine which they called, The cup of praiſe; and thus it ſhould be with the Saints; at all times, upon all occaſions, in all places they ſhould ſing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to God: O but when they are at the Lords Supper, then they ſhould ſing the great <hi>Hallelujah;</hi> but how they will be ever able to ſing this great <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> except firſt or laſt, more or leſſe, God gives them ſome aſſurance of their intereſt and propriety in himſelf, I cannot for my life diſcern. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> There is in all believers the choice and precious ſprings of aſſurance, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. Union and communion with the Father and the Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us, and truly our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:62683:243"/>is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now that union that is between the foundation and the building, the head and the members, the husband and the wife, the father and the child, the ſubject and the Prince, the body and the ſoul, is nothing ſo neer an union as that which is between a believer and God. Beſides,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.16, 17.</note> that union that a Chriſtian hath with God is an honourable union, and it is an inſeparable union, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible union, and it is an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting union. Now how it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a man to have ſuch a neer and ſuch a glorious union and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God from the day of his converſion to the day of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and yet never come to any aſſurance of his intereſt and propriety in God, is a thing not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily imaginable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Precious faith is another ſpring of aſſurance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Whom having not ſeen ye love, in whom though now ye ſee him not, yet believing, ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:62683:244"/>with joy unspeakable, and full of glory.</hi> Now this ſpring is in all the Saints, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. The faith of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance will in time riſe up into a faith of reliance, and the faith of reliance will in time advance it ſelf into a faith of aſſurance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hope is another ſpring of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Chriſt in you, the hope of glory.</hi> Heb. 6.19. <hi>Which hope we have as an anchor of the ſoul both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that within the vail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A good conſcience is another ſpring of aſſurance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Real love to the Saints is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſpring of aſſurance, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And laſtly, the Spirit of God is another ſpring of aſſurance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Now that a Chriſtian ſhould have all theſe choice ſprings of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in his ſoul, from his new birth, to the day of his death, and yet in all that time never come to aſſurance of his intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in God, is a thing, I had
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:62683:244"/>almoſt ſaid, beyond all belief. But</p>
            <p>Sixthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> There is nothing in all the world, that the hearts of the Saints are more frequently, more fervently, and more abundantly carried out after in all their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications, than this,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 4.6, 7.</note> That God would tell them that he is their portion, and that he would clear up their intereſt and propriety in himſelf; the conſtant language of their ſouls is this, Lord, do but tell us that thou art our portion, and then beſtow earthly portions upon whom thou pleaſeſt; do but clear up our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and propriety in thy ſelf,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.5, 6.</note> and then we ſhall ſay, Our lot is fallen in a pleaſant place, and verily we have a goodly heritage. Believers know, that aſſurance that God is their portion, and that they have an intereſt and propriety in him, will eaſe them of all their ſinful cares, fears, terrours, horrours, jealouſies, ſuſpitions, and ſad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:62683:245"/>which makes their lives a very hell; They know that aſſurance of their intereſt and propriety in God, will make every bitter ſweet, and every ſweet more ſweet, it will turn a Wilderneſſe into a Paradiſe, an Egypt into a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> They know that aſſurance that God is theirs will raiſe the trueſt comforts, the pureſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, the greateſt comforts, the ſureſt comforts,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.1, 2.</note> the ſtrongeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, the rareſt comforts, the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt comforts, and the moſt laſting comforts in their ſouls. They know that aſſurance of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God will fit them for the higheſt duties in Chriſtianity, and for the hardeſt duties in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and for the coſtlieſt duties in Chriſtianity, &amp; for the moſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, ſcorned, and deſpiſed duties in Chriſtianity; They know that aſſurance of their propriety in God will moſt quicken their graces, and act their graces, and raiſe their graces, and ſtrengthen their graces, and brighten their graces, and put
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:62683:245"/>a luſtre and a beauty upon their graces; They know that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their intereſt in God will wonderfully weaken ſin, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually crucifie their hearts to the world, and ſweetly moderate their affections to their neereſt and deareſt relations, and powerfully arm them both againſt the worlds oppoſitions, &amp; Satans temptations.</p>
            <p>To conclude, They know that aſſurance of their propriety in God will make death more deſirable than terrible, yea, it will make the thoughts of death ſweet, and the approaches of death eaſie, and all the warnings of death pleaſant to their ſouls, and therefore they follow God hard day and night, with ſtrong cries, prayers, tears, ſighs, and groans, that he would make it evident to them, that he is their portion, and that he would clear up their intereſt and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him. Now how can any man that is in his wits imagine, that God ſhould alwayes turn a deaf ear to the prayers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:62683:246"/>in this thing eſpecially, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that their prayers,
<note place="margin">Rom: 8.26, 27.</note> cries, tears, ſighs, and groans are but the products of his own Spirit in them; and conſidering likewiſe the ſeveral promiſes, whereby he hath ingaged himſelf to anſwer to the prayers of his people. I might tire both you and my ſelf in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe particular promiſes, but that I am reſolved againſt, and therefore take that for all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23, 24. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you. Ask and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full.</hi> This double aſſeveration <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> is never uſed, but in matters of greateſt weight and importance; and this gemination <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> is a vehement confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the truth of what Chriſt ſpeaks. Now from this gracious promiſe I may ſafely and clearly infer, That if God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will give to believers whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ask in the name of Chriſt, then certainly, at firſt or

But</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, If God ſhould not ſooner or later, more or leſſe, aſſure his people that he is their portion, &amp; that they have an intereſt &amp; a propriety in him then, he would be a very great loſer (if I may ſo ſpeak) he would loſe many praiſes, and many thankſgivings, he would loſe much of that love, of that honour, and of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and of that admiration, which otherwiſe he might have from among his children. And it is very obſervable, that of all the duties of Religion there are none that are preſt ſo cloſely, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and ſo ſtrongly upon
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:62683:247"/>Chriſtians, as thoſe of praiſing of God,
<note place="margin">I might produce above a hundred Scriptures to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this.</note> and rejoycing in God, &amp;c. as all know that know any thing of the Scripture. Now how it will ſtand with the holineſſe of God, and with the wiſdome of God, and with the care of God to be ſo great a loſer in the very things which he hath ſo roundly and earneſtly preſt upon his people, when as by one ſweet word of his mouth he might ſo eaſily and ſo happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, I cannot eaſily diſcern. All believers know, that there is no ſuch ready, no ſuch effectual way under heaven to draw out their love, their joy, their delight, their praiſes, and their thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings to God, as Gods aſſuring of them that he is their portion, and that they have an unqueſtionable intereſt and propriety in him. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that God that loves the praiſes of his people, and that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the rejoycings of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that is ſo infinitely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the thankſgivings of his people, that God will not alwayes
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:62683:247"/>hide himſelf from his people, that God will ſooner or later ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf to his people, that they ſhall be able to ſee their intereſt and propriety in God, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly to ſay, The Lord is our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now, O you that are the people of the Lord, and that to this very day do lie under many fears and doubts about your intereſt and propriety in God, be not diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, do not hang down the head, do not deſpond, do not deſpair, for certainly ſooner or later God will aſſure you, that he is your portion, and that you have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and a propriety in him.</p>
